#*
   
 A very early and naive attempt to convert c-style comments to bash one-line
 comments. Not very good because it doesnt parse quoted text.

read;
"/" { 
   read; 
   "//" { clear; add "# "; until "\n"; print; clear; } 
   "/*" { 
     clear; add "# "; until "*/"; clip; clip; 
     replace "\n" "\n#";
     print; clear;
   } 
 }
 print;
 clear;
