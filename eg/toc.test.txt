  Table of contents: [toc]

# ABOUT
  

  This script is just to show how to parse and render an 'index'
  or table of contents. 
  foot(toc is an abbreviation for "table of contents")
  The trick is to use the nom://go and nom://mark
  commands to reserve a cell for the index

# TOKENS

  parse tokens foot(see chomsky for grammar theory) used in this script

  heading* a line starting with #
  word*    one word
  text*    everything
  nl*      a newline so that we preserve the line-breaks in the text
  space*   all other whitespace

# NOTES

  This foot(this means not this in this context)
  could include self-testing etc but for the time being I 
  am keeping it simple 

  [foot]

# TESTING

  sed -n '/#\*/,/\/p' toc.pss > toc.test.txt
