    
## NOM EXAMPLE SCRIPTS

 This folder contains some example scripts in the [nom] script language.
 Scripts have the file extension ".pss". These examples can be run using the
 interpreter and debugger (the "pep" interpreter) or by translating to
 [nom:translation.links] and then (maybe compiling and) running.
 
 /doc/doc.dir.index.html contains a list of scripts and documents 
 in this folder.

 Documentation for the [nom] language and [pep] virtual machine is 
 in the /doc/ folder.

 The scripts which begin with *ro.* are solutions (or attempted solutions)
 to problems on the www.rosettacode.org site. For example 
 the script file://ro.balanced.brackets.pss solves the 
 rosetta://balanced.brackets problem .

 * examples can be run with the interpreter by typing
 ----
  pep -f eg/script.pss <inputfile>
  # or
  pep -f eg/script.pss -i <inputtext>
 ,,,,

 Examples can be translated into [nom:translation.links] by running
 the appropriate translation script.

 * translate a nom script into go, compile and run
 ---
   pep -f tr/translate.go.pss eg/script.pss > script.go
   go build script.go
   echo "<input>" | ./script
 ,,,,

 Also the script /eg/nom.to.pss will translate a script with a simple 
 prompt.

 * translate a script to 'rust' with nom.to.pss and compile (with rustc) 
 >> pep -f nom.to.pss -i 'translate script.pss to rust'

 Some scripts also have *self-translation* (for example /eg/json.check.pss
 and /eg/maths.tolatex.pss and /eg/text.tohtml.pss) 

### SOME EXAMPLE SCRIPTS

  - /eg/xml.parse.pss is an [xml] parser and error checker
  - /eg/nom.reference.syntax.pss is a syntax checker for the [nom]
    language which provides precise error messages.
  - /eg/json.check.pss checks the syntax of a [json] text data file.
  - /eg/text.tohtml.pss transforms a "plain-text" (minimal mark-up) document
     into html
  - /eg/sed.tojava.pss transpiles a gnu [sed] script into the [java] language
    (branch syntax with 't' etc is not supported because java has not [goto]
     statement )
  - /eg/maths.parse.pss parses and error checks arithmetic infix
     expressions.
  - /eg/maths.tolatex.pss transforms arithmetic, symbolic and logical
     expressions into printable [latex] formulas.
  - /eg/exp.tolisp.pss transforms an arithmetic infix expression into 
    [lisp] This is a simpler and older version of the 2 scripts above
  - /eg/toybnf.pss translates simple [bnf] type grammar rules into
    [nom] scripts. This is the basis for a *bnf* style parsing 
    and compiling language
  - /eg/natural.language.pss implements a limited natural language (English) 
    parser. I plan to expand this with a better 'phrase grammar'
  - /eg/tocfoot.tohtml.pss demonstrates creating a table of contents 
    and a *footer* (for footnotes) and using markers in the source document
    to place the table of contents and footers (this uses [toc] and [foot]
    as markers.

### NAMING

 *.noself.* in the filenames means that there is no self-translation or
 self-help or self-testing in the script.

 The scripts are often named for the format or language that they translate
 to such as text.tohtml.pss or nom.tolatex.pss

### IDEAS FOR EXAMPLE SCRIPTS

  - dictionary or glossary formatting:
     A script to format a plain-test dictionary into html and [latex]
     using a standard dictionary format.
  - a drawing/animation language:
    or invent a new drawing/animation/gaming language (getting ambitious which
    has a slightly more sensible syntax than that of the "logo" language.
    I started this in /eg/drawlang.pss which transpiles to python, but 
    I haven't continued.

#: The ---+ delimiter means that what follows is nom code.
