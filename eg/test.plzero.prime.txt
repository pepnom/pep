  This pl/0 file is to test the pep script plzero.pss
  which checks the syntax of a pl/0 program and outputs
  the program in a standard format.

  pl/0 is language designed by N.Wirth for teaching the 
  design of compilers.

  The program below calculates prime numbers
  Some code has no purpose, it is just there to check the parser
