  This file is just supposed to test multiline quotes and commands
  It can be used with the pep engine or with one of the generated engines
  (java, python, tcl etc)

HISTORY 
  
  17 july 2021
    revising. each language has a list of special chars
    which may do funny things in a string, such as 
    doing string interpolation. That needs to be disabled.
    we can use the "replace" command. eg in ruby
    replace "#{" "\#{". TCL also has special chars in strings.

r; add ":1st Line 
2nd Line, no indent
  \" we should be able to use double quotes \"
  3rd Line, 2 char indent
    4th Line, 4 char indent.\n"; 
add 'multline 
  with single quotes like this \'quote\'
  "double quotes here "
  will it work I wonder? ';
add "different 
 chars are special in different languages.
 eg #{var} does variable interpolation in ruby
 so we should disable it ";
