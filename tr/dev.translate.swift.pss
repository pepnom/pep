###   translate.swift.pss 

   (in dev, not working). translate nom scripts in the swift language
   
   Dont know how to read one char from stdin!!


   This is a parse-script which translates any pep script into swift
   code, using the 'pep' tool. The script creates a standalone 
   swift program. The script can also translate itself (since it is
   a pep script!).
   
   The virtual machine and engine is implemented in plain c at
   http://bumble.sf.net/books/pars/pep.c This implements a script
   language with a syntax reminiscent of sed and awk (simpler than
   awk, but more complex than sed).
   
STATUS

   6 july 2021

   Just began to convert from ruby. Quite alot of conversion, but a bit stuck
   on how to read one char from stdin!!! This should not be such a big
   problem but is. I dont seem to be able to install swift on my linux
   distro, so will have to do this on the macbook.

NOTES
   
   Probably these translation scripts should be rewritten with a 
   simpler grammar. The current grammar is actually based on the 
   "compile.pss" code which has a special requirement! Namely, the 
   compile.pss code needs to calculate exactly label jumps for the 
   assembly-style output. (Actually this may no longer be true, but
   it was when the compile.pss code was written). BUT, the translater
   scripts do not have that requirement at all. This means we can 
   have a simpler and more logical grammar for the translator scripts
   where the AND and OR logic test sets (eg E"a",!"b",!B"a" { ... } )
   can be reduced "as they are seen" rather than "backwards". Have 
   a look at the "compile.pss" code to see what that means.

   regexs seem silly in swift but using foundation maybe less so.
   ----
   import Foundation
   let invitation = "Fancy a game of Cluedo™?"
   invitation.range(of: #"\bClue(do)?™?\b"#,
                 options: .regularExpression) != nil // true
   let pattern = #"(\d+)[ \p{Pd}](\d+) players"#
   // Pd is a unicode category punctuation dash, so maybe the 
   // equivalent of [[:punct:]] etc
   ,,,,

   In other translation scripts, we use labelled loops and
   break/continue to implement the parse> label and .reparse .restart
   commands. Breaks could be used to implement the quit command but arent.

   Does swift support labelled loops? If not, one option is to set a flag
   when .restart .reparse is called to break the outer loop

   We can use "run once" loops eg " while true do ... break; end " an 
   example is in the translate.tcl.pss script. 

TODO

   Maybe convert the generated code to use a "parse" method with 
   some kind of a stream reader. This allows the generated python
   to be used by other python classes/objects, and to parse/compile
   different types of input (string/file/stream/stdin etc)

SEE ALSO
   
   At http://bumble.sf.net/books/pars/

   tr/translate.java.pss, tr/translate.py.pss
     A very similar script for compiling scripts into java and python

   compile.pss
     compiles a script into an "assembly" format that can be loaded
     and run on the parse-machine with the -a  switch. This performs
     the same function as "asm.pp" 

TESTING

   A simple "state" command may be useful for debugging these 
   translation scripts.

   * use the bash helper functions to test (from helpers.pars.sh)
   >> pep.swf eg/palindrome.pss 'hannah'

   The line above compiles the script to swift in the folder
   pars/eg/swift/palindrome.swift and runs it with the input "hannah"

   check multiline text with 'add' and 'until'

   It is possible to run the translater script on itself (!) 

   * translate the translater
   >> pep -f translate.swift.pss translate.swift.pss > eg/swift/translate.sw.sw
   Then compile and run as a "filter" program, reading input from 
   standard input.

WATCH OUT FOR

  treatment of regexes is different (for while whilenot etc). Eg in
  ruby [[:space:]] is unicode aware but \s is not

  "until" needs to actually count how many trailing '\' or
  escape chars there are !...

  make sure .reparse and .restart work before and after the 
  parse> label. 

  Make sure escaping and multiline arguments work.

  "until" may not not read at least one character. That is a bug!

BUGS
   
  "until" may not not read at least one character even when the
  workspace already ends with the given text. That is a bug!
  multiline add not working?

  mark code may not be correct

SOLVED BUGS IN OTHER TRANSLATER SCRIPTS 

  * the line below is throwing an error and probably shouldnt (compile.pss)
  >> add '", "\\'; get; add '")'; --; put; clear;

  Multiline 'add' cannot add extra spaces, especially for python which 
  is indent sensitive!

  Java needs a double escape \\\\ before some chars, but ruby doesnt.

  'escape' needs to use the machine escape char. 
  found and fixed a bug in java whilenot/while. The code exits if the 
  character is not found, which is not correct.

  Found and fixed a bug in the (==) code ie in java (stringa == stringb)
  doesnt work. 

  Read must exit if at end of stream, but while/whilenot/until, no.

TASKS 

HISTORY

  19 june 2022
    revising

  june 2021
    Began, adapting from the ruby translater
    May need to fix "until" to make it count trailing escape chars
    check "mark/go"
    need to check replace

    At line 348 added an unknown char class test, that should go into
    the other tr/ scripts.
