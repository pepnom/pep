 testing begin-blocks which are similar to awk's begin rules
 in that they are only executed once when the script starts.

 They are useful for setting any configuration parameters for

 start-up messages.

 The rest of the script has an implicit loop (with one iteration
 for each character of the input stream.

 begin {
   add "starting script... \n";
   print; clear;
 }
 read; print;
