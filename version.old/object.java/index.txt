JAVA PARSER MACHINE

  The files in this folder will probably not be used now
  (july 2020) because the script /books/pars/compile.java.pss
  includes the java Machine class in its code.

  A nearly complete java implementation of the parsing 
  virtual machine object (but not a script interpreter or compiler).

HISTORY

 * july 2020
   
   rewrote compile.java.pss so that it doesnt require any 
   external code.

 * October 2019

   wrote compile.java.pss which translates scripts into java.
   This appears to be working for many scripts.

 * August 2019
  
   a good c implementation is now available at /books/gh/object/gh.c
   and accompanying files. A number of useful scripts (with file
   extension .pss) have been written using this implementation.
   Having reinspected the (9 years) old java code, it seems that the 
   Machine java object is actually nearly complete and quite compatible
   with the new "struct Machine" object written in c (which is located
   at books/gh/object/machine.c). Also the methods for the java 
   Machine object are similar to the methods in 
   books/gh/object/machine.methods.c

   This means that we can use a script very similar to 
   compilable.c.pss to generate compilable java code using this 
   Machine object.

 * September 2010

   Did a lot of new work on this project. A nearly complete
   implementation is available, but its taken a long time.

   Another older and less complete attempt is at /pp/java/try1/
