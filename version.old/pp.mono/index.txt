** The pp.mono folder

This folder contains a copy of the gh.c code as it was when
the entire application (including machine and program objects) was
in one c source file. This code is now out of date (august 2019)!

See the code in the /books/gh/object/ folder for an up-to-date 
implementation of the parsing virtual machine and interpreter.
