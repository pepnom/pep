 ** example scripts


  This directory contains some scripts which demonstrate the 
  use of the stream-parser. The stream parser is able to do 
  interesting things such as parse and translate itself (or
  its own language. The basic purpose of the stream parser is to 
  provide a text and stream based method for parsing and 
  transforming "formal languages" (->wikisearch) as defined by
  formal grammars or grammars in "backus-naur" format.

  In particular, the file "check-syntax.txt" demonstrates how the 
  stream parse language can be used to parse itself and check
  for syntax errors in a given script.
