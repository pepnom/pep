 && How to compile the pp tool
 -----------------------------------------

 These instructions will most probably change as the c source
 will be divided into small files for the sake of maintainability.
 
-On an x86 computer-

  a- download the "tiny c" http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/tcc/  
   - unzip the tiny c distribution in some folder
   - download file:library.c and file:chomski.c and place the 
     two files in the "tcc" folder (which was created when the tiny c
     distribution was unzipped.
   - compile with a command line such as 
  :>  \tcc\tcc -I\tcc\include -L\tcc\lib chomski.c 
   - The resulting executable is around 40k

-On a non-x86 computer-

  a- download file://library.c and file://chomski.c
   - download or obtain a c compiler, for example the GNU c
     compiler.
   - compile the code. The exact proceedure I dont know because
     I havent done it.
