  && The counter variable in the chomski machine 

 The counter variable withing the chomski @virtual-machine
 is an integer variable which may be incremented with the 
 @plus command, decremented with the @minus command, and set
 to zero with the @zero command. 
 
 The counter variable may be used to count line numbers, 
 character occurances, brace nesting depth or something else. For example, the
 following script counts the number of ':' characters present
 in a given input text stream and prints the result to 
 <stdout>

 -->
  /:/
   { plus; }
  clear;
  <>
  {
    add 'The number of ":" characters is ';
    count;
    print;
  }
 --<
