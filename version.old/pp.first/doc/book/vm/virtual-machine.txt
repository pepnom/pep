  ** the virtual machine 

  The "virtual machine" [->wikipedia] for the bumble language looks like this

   -machine-
   -stack:...,...,...,...
   -tape:...,...,...,...,...,
   -workspace:
   -peep:
   -counter:

  The machine has four main elements
   D- a @stack:
      which can contain "parse tokens" [->wikipedia] if the language
      is used for parsing or any other text data.
    - a @tape:
      which is an array of text data which is synchronized with the 
      machine stack using a tape pointer. The tape is manipulated 
      with the @get and @put commands
    - a @tape-pointer :
      This variable determines the current tape element which will
      be used by @get and @put commands. The tape pointer is incremented
      with the ++ command and decremented with the -- command.
    - a @workspace buffer:
      This is where all "text change" operations within the machine are 
      carried out. It is similar in concept to a register within
      a "cpu" [->wikipedia] or to the "Sed" [->wikipedia] stream editor
      pattern space. The workspace is affected by various commands, 
      such as @clear, @add, @indent, @get, @push, @pop etc
    - a @peep character:
      this character is not directly manipulable, but it constitutes
      a very simple "look ahead" mechanism and is used by the 
      @while and @whilenot commands
    - a @counter :
      This counter or "accumulator" is an integer variable which can
      be incremented with the command @plus ,decremented with the 
      command @minus ,and set to zero with the command @zero .

 ** Language commands and the machine

  Most of the commands in the script language affect the virtual machine.
  For example, the -pop- command takes the last element off the stack
  and appends it to the -front- of the workspace. We can see this
  by looking at the virtual machine before and after a pop command.

   -machine-
   -stack: noun* , verb* , noun*
   -tape: cat , hunts ,  bird , --> ,...,
   -workspace: noun*
   -peep: t

  After the @pop command the machine will look like this 

   -machine-
   -stack: noun* , verb*
   -tape: cat , hunts , --> bird ,...,...,
   -workspace: noun*noun*
   -peep: t

 The stack is one element shorter and the workspace has changed
