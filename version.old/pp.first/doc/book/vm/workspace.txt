  && The workspace buffer in the virtual machine 

  The workspace buffer is a buffer within the virtual machine of 
  the stream parsing language. In this buffer all of the text
  transformation processed take place. For example, the commands
  @clear, @add, @indent, @newline all affect the text in the 
  workspace buffer.

  The machine looks like this

   -machine-
   -workspace:
   -stack:...,...,...,...
   -tape:...,...,...,...,...,
   -peep:
   -counter:

  The workspace buffer is analogeous to a processor register 
  in a non-virtual cpu. In order to manipulate a value, it is
  generally necessary to first load that value into a 
  cpu register. In the same way, in order to manipulate some 
  text in the chomski machine, it is necessary to first
  load that text into the workspace buffer. This can be 
  achieve with the @get, @pop, @read commands.
