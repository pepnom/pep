 && The stack structure in the virtual machine   

  The 'virtual'-machine of the chomski language contains
  a stack structure which is primarily intended to hold
  the parse tokens during the parsing and transformation
  of a text pattern or language. However, the stack 
  could hold any other string data.  Each element of the
  stack structure is a string buffer of unlimited size. 

  The stack is manipulated using the @pop and @push commands.
  When a value is popped off the stack, that value is appended
  to the -front- of the @workspace buffer. If the stack is 
  empty, then the pop command has no effect.
