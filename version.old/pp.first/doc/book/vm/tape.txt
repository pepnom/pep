 && The tape in the chomski machine 

 The tape structure in the @virtual-machine is an infinite
 array of elements. Each of these elements is a string buffer
 of infinite size. The elements of the tape structure may be 
 accessed using the @increment , @decrement , @get and @put
 commands. 

 ** The tape and the stack

 The tape structure in the virtual machine and the @stack
 structure and designed to be used in tandem, and several
 mechanisms have been provided to enable this. For example,
 when a @pop operation is performed, the @tape-pointer is
 automatically decremented, and when a @push operation is
 performed then the tape pointer is automatically incremented.

 Since the chomski language and machine have been designed
 to carry out parsing and transformation operations on
 text streams, the tape and stack are intended to hold
 the values and tokens of the parsing process.
