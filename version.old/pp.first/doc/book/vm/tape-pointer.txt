  && The virtual machine tape pointer 

  The tape pointer in the chomski machine designates the current
  element of the @tape data structure. The @get and the @put 
  command will automatically use the current element of the 
  tape structure. The value of the tape pointer can be changed 
  with the @increment (++) and the @decrement (--) commands.

  Consider the virtual machine diagram below

   -machine-
   -stack:...,...,...,...
   -tape:...,...,...,...,-->...,
   -workspace:
   -counter:
   -peep:

  The arrow in the above diagram indicates the location (or value)
  of the tape pointer. This pointer has the function of maintaining
  the virtual machine stack and tape in a kind of syncronization.   
  The "++" and "--" commands affect the tape pointer explicitly,
  and the @push command and the @pop command of the stack affect
  the tape pointer implicitly. The pop comand decrements the 
  tape pointer by one and the push command increments the tape pointer 
  by one.

  If we regard the language and virtual machine as a method for 
  parsing "formal languages" [->wikipedia] or in particular
  "context free languages" [->wikipedia] then the stack will contain
  the parse tokens for the input and the tape will contain the 
  token values for the input. The tape pointer allows the script
  writer to easily access the value for a particular 
  "parse token" [->wikipedia] because the pointer keeps the two data
  structures synchronized. After a particular "-pop" operation
  the tape pointer will be pointing to the value for the token which
  has just been placed in the "-workspace" buffer.
 
  Consider the script fragment
  -->
   pop; #- decrements the tape pointer -#   
   /variable*/
   {
     #- set the workspace to nothing -#
     clear;
     #- get the current value from the tape -#
     get;
     ...
   }

  --<
  In the script above the "-get" command gets the value
  from the tape to which the tape pointer is currently pointing.
  Because the tape and stack are in sync that value will
  be the value corresponding to the token which has just 
  been popped into the workspace.

 ** get and put

 The get and put commands do -not- affect the tape pointer. it is
 neither decremented nor incremented by these commands.
