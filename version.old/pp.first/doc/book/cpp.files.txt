 ** a description of the c++ language interpreter files

  In general the file endings are 
  D- dev:
     the devcpp project files
   - name.main.cpp:
     a program to test the name.cpp class
   - name.cpp:
     a class which is part of the -machine- implementation

  D- file:/machine/Instruction.cpp :
     represents one instruction in a compiled Program.
  - file:/machine/Instruction.dev :
     the bloodshed "devcpp" http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html
     project file for the Instruction class
  - file:/machine/Instruction.exe :
     an ms-windows executable to test the Instruction class
     This file is the result of compiling the Instruction.dev
     project in the devcpp compiler.
  - file:/machine/Instruction.h :
     the header file for the Instruction class
  - file:/machine/Instruction.main.cpp :
     a c++ program to test the Instruction class
  - file:/machine/Machine.cpp :
     The implementation of a @virtual-machine which is the 
     basis of the parsing script language. See the file:/machine/java
     directory for an older implentation in java
  - file:/machine/Machine.dev :
     the project file for the virtual Machine class
  - file:/machine/Machine.exe :
     an ms-windows exe to test the Machine class
  - file:/machine/Machine.h :
     The c++ header file for the Machine class
  - file:/machine/Machine.main.cpp :
     a program to test the Machine class. Allows operations to be
     performed on the machine and to watch the changes in the 
     state of the machine.
  - file:/machine/makefile.win :
     a ms-windows specific makefile which was generated by the 
     devcpp compiler. could be used as the basis of a unix make 
     file.
  - file:/machine/Parser.cpp :
     A class which parses and compiles the  script language.
     this class parses a script written in the language and compiles it
     into an array format using the Program class. This parsing and
     compiling operation removes the need to reparse the script for each
     character in the input stream. 
  - file:/machine/Parser.dev :
     the devcpp project file for the Parser class
  - file:/machine/Parser.exe :
     this is an ms-windows executable which tests the Parser class.
     The executable also acts as an interpreter for a given script
     since it invokes the "run" method on the Program object which 
     is created by the parser.
  - file:/machine/Parser.h :
  - file:/machine/Parser.main.cpp :
     This is a program to test the Parser class which also acts
     as an interpreter for the script language.
  - file:/machine/Program.cpp :
     represents a compiled script.
  - file:/machine/Program.dev :
     the devcpp project file.
  - file:/machine/Program.exe :
  - file:/machine/Program.h :
  - file:/machine/Program.main.cpp :
     a program to test the Program class. This is very useful
     for learning about the parse language and ":virtual-machine"
     because it provides a command interpreter which allows the 
     user to add instructions to a test program and execute them
     while watching the changes in the state of the virtual machine.
  - file:/machine/Tape.cpp :
     represents the @tape data structure within the ":virtual-machine"
     The tape is essentially an array with a pointer.
  - file:/machine/Tape.exe :
     an ms-windows executable to test the Tape class
  - file:/machine/Tape.h :

 As can be seen by the above files, any of the classes can
 be tested by compiling the ".main.cpp" class which provides
 a program to test the class. To compile the .main.cpp class
 on a windows computer the bloodshed devcpp compiler can be 
 used and by loading the ".dev" project file.

 For example, to compile the file:/machine/Machine.main.cpp file
 load the file:/machine/Machine.dev project file in the devcpp
 compiler and use the menu compile option. By loading the ".dev"
 project file all dependency class will be automatically loaded into
 the compiler.

 ** other files

  D-file:/machine/Interpret.cpp :
     a class which parses and generates c++ source code
     for a given script. The source code can the be compiled in
     order to execute the script. 
  - file:/machine/Interpret.dev :
     The "devcpp" http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html project file
  - file:/machine/Interpret.exe :
     An ms-windows executable
  - file:/machine/Interpret.h :
  - file:/machine/Interpret.main.cpp :
  - file:/machine/Interpretor.dev :
  - file:/machine/Compile.cpp :
  - file:/machine/Parser.all.cpp :
  - file:/machine/MachineBasic.cpp :
     an older version of the @virtual-machine
