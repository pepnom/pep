 = The tape test =

 The tape test determines if the current element of 
 the @tape structure is the same as the @workspace buffer.

 The tape test is written
  :> ==

 ** The virtual machine

  By looking at the virtual machine we can get a clearer idea of
  how this test operates. Consider a machine which is in the 
  following state:

  -machine-
  -workspace: 123
  -stack    : variable* , equals* , number*
  -tape     : x , =  , --> 123 , ... ,
  -peep     : ;
  -counter  :0

  Now the interpreter encounters the statements 
    :> == { print; }

  The '==' test determines if the @workspace buffer holds exactly
  the same value as the current tape cell. In the diagram above
  the current tape cell is indicated by the presence of an arrow.
  In the case the test returns true because the workspace has the 
  same value and the @tape cell, and therefore the statement within
  the braces is executed. The output will be
   :> 123

 ** Notes

 This test was included original in order to parse the sed structure
   :> s@old@new@g  or s/old/new/g or s%old%new%g
 In other words, in sed, any character can be used to delimite the 
 text in a substitue command.
 In chomski, we could parse this with
 -->
   /s/ { clear; add 'substitute*'; push; 
 --<
