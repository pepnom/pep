 = the List test in the omski language =

 The list test may be written as
 :> :nouns.txt: { ... } 

 The list test determines if the workspace matches any one
 of a list of strings which are contained within a text
 file. In the example given above the name of the text file
 is "nouns.txt". If the "workspace;" was "dog" at the time
 that the test was executed and the string "dog" was 
 contained in the text file "nouns.txt", then the test would
 return -true- and the instructions within the braces would
 be executed. However if the word "dog" was not contained
 in the text file then the test would return false, and 
 the instructions within the braces would -not- be 
 executed.

 This test may be useful in a linguistic context, in order
 to determine if a particular string is a noun, verb, 
 or other part of speech.
