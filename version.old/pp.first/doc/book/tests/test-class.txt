 = The class test =

  The class text checks whether the @workspace buffer
  matches any one of the characters or character classes
  listing between the square braces.  A class test is written
    :> [characters] { ...  }

  For example, the following script will delete all vowels
  from the input text
  :> [aeiou] { clear; }  ![aeiou] { print; clear; }

  The above script also demonstrates that the class tests
  can be -negated- with a prefixed "!" character.

  If the workspace is exactly any one of the characters contained
  within the square braces then the test returns true and the 
  instructions contained within the curly braces are executed and
  if not, then not. 

 ** Escaping characters

   
 ** Character classes

  The class test also permits "character classes", for example
   D- [-a]:
     matches if the @workspace is any alphanumeric character
    - [-n]:
     matches if the workspace is a newline character
    - [-r]:
     matches if the workspace is an \r character
    - [-t]:
     matches if the workspace is a tab character
    - [- ]:
     matches if the workspace is any whitespace character
     including <newline> characters
    - [-s]:
     matches if the workspace is any whitespace character
     but excluding <newline> characters.
    - [-:]:
     matches if the workspace is a punctuation character
    - [-1]:
     matches if the workspace is a digit

  These character classes may be combined within one class 
  For example, the following script will print the workspace if
  the workspace is either an alphanumeric character or a 
  whitespace character

   :> [-a- ] { print; }
   
 ** Not regular expressions

  These class tests look similar to the class
  tests found in "regular expression" definitions, but they are
  different in a number of ways. For example, the normal unix
  regular expression structure of "character ranges" is not 
  supported. For example, in a unix regular expression system
  (sed, grep, perl ...) the class [a-z] refers to any lower case
  roman letter, and this is refered to as a class range. This
  is not supported in the script language. The reason for this 
  difference, is that the chomski language was designed with
  international character sets in mind, and a range such as 
  "a-z" requires a knowledge of the order of characters within 
  the character encoding system, which may be obvious in the 
  case of roman letters, but will not be obvious in other 
  alphabetic systems.
