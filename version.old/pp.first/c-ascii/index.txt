 ** A Ascii C implementation of the Pattern Parser tool  

 This folder contains a c implementation of the 'pp' tool which uses
 the standard c 'char' datatype for manipulating strings. For this reason
 the version is not particularly useful for writing scripts which will
 deal with text in foreign language encodings or modern encodings such as
 utf-8. 

 This implementation was largely working appart from a bug in the 
 implementation of the 'pop' and 'push' commands.
