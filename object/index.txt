## THE PEP INTERPRETER OBJECT/ FOLDER

  This folder contains the implementation of the pep interpreter
  (in the c language with byte characters) and it also contains the 
  files which are required when compiling a nom script to c with the 
  script /tr/translate.c.pss

  The pep interpreter includes a good interactive script debugger which 
  can be activated with the '-I' switch. This allows you to "step through"
  nom scripts and view the state of the pep virtual pep://machine after 
  each instruction.

  See the document /doc/howto/nom.debug.html for more information about 
  debugging nom scripts.

### Compiling

  The code in this folder can be compiled with a c compiler such as gcc or tcc
  and the script /object/make.pepnom.sh (but the script should be in the parent
  folder).

### Notes

  This folder is hosted on the sourceforge nom site at nomsf://object/
  and also at www.nomlang.org/object/
