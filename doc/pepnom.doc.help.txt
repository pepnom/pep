## HELP WANTED

 The pep/nom system is an open-source non-commercial project designed
 to experiment with new ways of recognising, parsing, checking, translating,
 transforming and compiling text patterns or context-free and context 
 sensitive formal languages. As far as I know, nobody, except myself 
 uses it or knows about it. 

 The system has slowly developed into something that can be used for 
 practical purposes. But it really needs helpers to experiment with it,
 debug it, debug the translation scripts, write useful example scripts
 and maybe even augment it.
 
 Now that there are a considerable number of working translation scripts 
 (that can translate to [nom:translation.links] )
 in the /tr/ folder it is becoming a big job for me to maintain, debug
 and update them all. For example there are currently 2 types of translation
 scripts in the /tr/ folder: the older style ones that are called
 for example /tr/translate.go.pss and the new style scripts that are 
 called, for example /tr/nom.torust.pss

 The new ones are *much* better, for all sorts of reasons, and have 
 less bugs and are better considered in terms of unicode codepoints 
 and grapheme clusters. But converting all the older scripts to the 
 new organisation is a reasonably big job- at least a job that could take
 several days, if not weeks. So feel free to help with that.

 Another sort of help would be a simple appraisal of the potential of 
 the system and how it might be improved. Since I have never found 
 any domain-specific language (or text-register machine) that is similar
 to pep/nom , I have nothing to compare it with. Really the system that
 is most similar is the sed stream editor.

 Some helpful tasks, thanks in advance:

   - debug the example scripts, for example the /eg/xml.parse.pss script
     is pretty naive at the moment or at least, not very *compliant* .
   - debug the translation scripts in the /tr/ folder
   - convert the pep interpreter, which is written in plain c and implemented
     in the /object/ folder, to wchar wide characters, or write it in 
     a completely different language like C++, rust, zig or something else.
   - write new translators for different languages like zig, R, Julia, Lisp,
     Haskell, etc.
   - Write a translator for the Forth language, which is no easy task because
     the translator will have to handle memory management for appending 
     to the string array. But this translator could be very important because
     it would allow complex language definitions on very small machines 
     such as microcontrollers.
   - improve the documentation in the /doc/ folder.  
   - write a nom script that parses the YAML format.
   - write a nom script that does type checking and type inference for 
     some programming language (this is possible, trust me, and I will 
     at some stage get around to doing this).
