## THE PEP/NOM WORKSPACE BUFFER

  The *workspace* : a string manipulation buffer in the [pep] machine

  The workspace buffer is the centre of the pep/nom virtual-machine and is 
  analogous to an "accumulator" register in a cpu chip. All incoming
  and outgoing text data is processed through the workspace. All machine
  instructions either affect or are affected by the state of the 
  workspace.

  The workspace buffer is analogous to a processor register in a non-virtual
  cpu. In order to manipulate a value, it is generally necessary to first load
  that value into a cpu register. In the same way, in order to manipulate some
  text in the pep machine, it is necessary to first load that text into the
  workspace buffer. This can be achieved with the nom://get , nom://pop , 
  and nom://read commands.

### commands that manipulate text in the workspace

  - nom://clear delete all text in the workspace
  - nom://add append text to the workspace
  - nom://replace replace text in the workspace
  - nom://clip
  - nom://clop

### transfer text to and from the workspace

  - nom://push and nom://pop
  - nom://get and nom://put
  - nom://read nom://until nom://while and nom://whilenot
