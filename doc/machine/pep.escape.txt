## THE NOM ESCAPE CHARACTER REGISTER

  The escape character register in the [pep] machine

  The pep,nom machine contains a (one) character register which contains
  the current escape character that is recognised by nom scripts.
  This is particularly important for the nom://until command because the 
  *until* command 'reads past' end delimiters which are escaped.

  The pep escape character can be set with the nom://echar command.
  Also, escaping and unescaping of text in the pep://workspace buffer
  is handled by the nom://escape and nom://unescape commands respectively.

### NOTES

  The management of escape and unescape logic is somewhat more delicate 
  than would at first appear. For example should a character in the 
  workspace that is already escaped with the current machine escape 
  character, be escaped by the nom://escape command? No, these character
  sequences are left unchanged. So if the current escape character is 
  "\\" and the workspace is "ab\\cd" then the command 'escape "c";' will
  do nothing.

  Also, escaping the escape character itself has some logical wrinkles 
  that need to be handled carefully in the different implementations 
  provided by the pepnom system (the pep interpreter and the various 
  "translation" /tr/ scripts).
