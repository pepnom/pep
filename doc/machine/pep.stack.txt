## THE PEP MACHINE "STACK"

  The stack within the Pep machine (Parsing Engine for Patterns) is a stack of
  strings which can be "pushed" nom://push and "popped" nom://pop
  The *pep* stack is designed to work in conjuction with, and be synchronized
  to the *pep* pep://tape (which is an array of strings with a pointer to 
  the current tape-cell)

  When a parse token is "popped" off the the stack, then the tape-pointer
  (or *current tape-cell* ) is "decremented" nom://-- so that the tape-pointer
  is pointing to the tape-cell which corresponds to the grammar 
  token which is at the *start* of the pep://workspace buffer. This means
  that as soon as you pop a grammar token off the stack, you can start
  working with the token's associated "attribute" .

  * add some fancy html quotes to a quoted word
  -----+
  # ... snippet
  parse>
    pop;
    "quotedword*" {
      clear; add "&ldquo;"; get; add "&rdquo;"; put; 
      clear; add "text*"; push; .reparse
    }
    push;
  ,,,,

  The stack is what allows the Pep engine to cope with nesting 
  patterns and other constructs of context-free and context-sensitive languages
  and text patterns. Perhaps the simplest example of a *nesting* text
  pattern are "palindromes" which are parsed in the example script
  /eg/palindrome.pss  Another more complex example of nesting text structures
  is found in XML text which is parsed in the example script
  /eg/xml.parse.pss .
