## THE PEP FLAG REGISTER 

  The 'flag' register: an internal [pep] machine register.

  Possibly, I should not even bother to document the *flag* register
  because you never explicitly access it when you are writing a 
  [nom] script. The flag register is used by the machine when 
  executing pep "assembly" /doc/pepnom.doc.assembly.html language 
  instructions.

  The flag register affects the operation of the conditional jump instructions
  "jumpfalse" and "jumptrue" and it is affected by the test instructions such
  as "testis", "testtape", "testeof" etc.  But these instructions are only used
  in [pep] assembler not in a nom script. The flag is analogous to a "flags"
  register in a CPU , but it only contains one boolean (true/false) value.

  * pep machine assembler instructions relating to the flag register
  >> testis, testbegins, testends, testtape, testeof 
  >> jumptrue, jumpfalse

  The nom script writer does not read or write the machine flag register
  directly. It is set automatically by the testing instructions

### NOTES 

  If you are curious about the *pep assembly* language (which is the format
  which is directly executed by the pep interpreter) then you can look at the
  file "sav.pp" /eg/sav.pp in any directory where you have run a nom script. The
  pep interpreter compiles any script to a *sav.pp* assembly file before it
  loads the script assembly and executes it, so you can see how any script is
  converted to assembly by looking at this file.
