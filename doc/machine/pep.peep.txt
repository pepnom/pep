  The peep buffer is a single character buffer which stores the next character
  in the input stream.  When a nom://read command is performed the current
  value of the peep buffer is appended to the pep://workspace buffer and the
  next character from the input stream is placed into the peep buffer.

  The "end-of-stream" tests *<eof> <EOF> (eof) (EOF)* check to see if the peep
  buffer contains the end of input stream marker. 

  The nom://while command reads from the input stream while the peep buffer is,
  or is not, some set of characters

   * read the input stream while the peep buffer is a,b or c 
   >> while [abc];

  The code below is implicitly using the *peep* register in the 
  *while* and *whilenot* commands

  * word by word parsing with while and whilenot
  -----+
    while [:space:]; clear;
    whilenot [:space:]; put; clear; add "word*"; push; 
   parse>
    pop; pop; 
    # print one word per line
    # grammar rules 
    #   text := ( word word ) | ( text word ) ;
    "word*word*","text*word*" {
      clear; get; add "\n"; ++; get; --; put;
      clear; add "text*"; 
      push; .reparse
    }
    push; push;
    (eof) { pop; clear; get; print; quit; }
