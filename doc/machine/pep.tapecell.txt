## THE CURRENT TAPE CELL IN THE PEP MACHINE

 About the current tape-cell in the pep://tape array

 I refer to the array of attributes that correspond to each 
 parse-token on the parse pep://stack as a pep://tape . I think this 
 is non-standard terminology. By a 'tape' I mean an (possibly infinite)
 array of mutable strings that includes a current valid pointer to 
 one of the array cells.
 
 The tape-cell that is currently pointed to by the tape-pointer I 
 refer to as the "tapecell" or "tape-cell" or "current cell" etc.
 The current cell of the *tape* is decremented by the 
 nom://pop command, incremented by the nom://push command and also
 can be incremented and decremented with the nom://++ and nom://--
 commands.

 The pop and push commands are designed so that the current tape cell
 is unchanged when a nom://pop is called on an empty parse stack,
 and also unchanged when a nom://push is called on an empty 
 pep://workspace buffer.

 This behaviour is designed to keep the pep pep://machine stack and 
 the tape "synchronised". That means that the tape-pointer should 
 point to the last parse-token popped into the workspace buffer.

 * the synchronised tape and stack

   # nom fragment
   pop;pop;pop;
   "size*angle*end*" {
     # The current tape cell points to the attribute 
     # corresponding to the size* parse token
     # do something with the attributes or parse tokens
     nop;
   }

 The nom:++ and nom:-- commands are used to "compile" or translate
 the parse token attributes when a shift-reduce rule is 
 applied in a nomsyn://block
