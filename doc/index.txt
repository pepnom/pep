### The Pep/Nom documents folder

 This folder contains documentation about the *Nom* interpreted and compilable
 language and the [pep] Pattern Engine for parsing.

 *Nom* is a language with a syntax similar to "sed"
 https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html but hopefully less cryptic
 than [sed] . Whereas *sed* matches and replaces "regular expression"
 wp://regular.expression patterns, *nom* recognises and transforms, translates
 or compiles context-free and context-sensitive text-patterns or languages.
 
 I keep a journal of mundane everyday work that I carry out on the 
 pep/nom system at /doc/pepnom.doc.journal.html and I sometimes write 
 more philosophical documents in a blog format in the "nomblog" /post/ 
 There is a document about how you could help develop the nom system
 "here" /doc/pepnom.doc.help.html and there is a list of things that I 
 need "to do" /doc/pepnom.doc.todo.html

 The folder /doc/commands/ contains information about 
 each command in the nom language such as the nom://add command, the 
 nom://push command and so on. The "command index" 
 /doc/commands/doc.dir.index.html contains a list of commands 
 and links to their documentation

 The folder /doc/syntax/ contains information about the syntax of the
 *nom* language, as it is defined in the nom compiler nomsf://compile.pss . The
 page file:///doc/syntax/doc.dir.index.html has a list of files in the syntax
 documentation.

 The folder /doc/machine/ contains documentation about 
 the *pep* "virtual machine" pep://machine and each of its parts such as
 the pep://stack , the pep://tape and the pep://workspace buffer among 
 others

 The example folder at /eg/ contains example nom scripts, each of which
 contain a header of documentation about what they do. The translation 
 folder at /tr/ contains the nom scripts that can translate nom scripts
 into other languages such as [nom:translation.links] and each of 
 those scripts also contains a documentation header explaining its function.

 A not very up-to-date list of the "documents" doc.dir.index.html in this
 folder is available.

 This website is also generated by the [nom] script /eg/text.tohtml.pss and the
 format of this "plain-text" is documented at /eg/text.tohtml.format.html .  I
 hope some of this is of interest. Enjoy the Deniliquin Fig Tree below.
