## Notes on publishing and promoting the pep pattern parser language system
  
 [pep] and [nom] is an open source project which implements a simple but
 interesting idea. [nom] is a "simple" language which can recognise and
 translate/transform/compile languages and text data formats. It implements a
 virtual machine which can create LR shift-reduce parsers/translators for some
 context-free languages. 
 
 I would like others to assess and collaborate with this system because I
 think it has enormous potential for changing the way that the average
 programmer approaches pattern and language problems. It might even be 
 of use and interest to linguists.
