 ## NAMING AND NAMING CONVENTIONS IN THE PEP/NOM SYSTEM 

 Originally I was going to call the whole system *pp* or *pep* (which was
 supposed to be an acronym for *Parsing Engine for Patterns* ) because it is
 short and *unixy* but then I decided to call the language that runs on top of
 the virtual machine *Nom* because it sounds nicer, is a vague reference to
 wp://noam.chomsky (who I think has definitely earned a few accolades) and
 because it seems a bit *indo-european* for "name".  If you start excavating in
 the source code and ancient files you will probably find references to the
 "pep" language. Ignore them please.

 Pep&nom was partly inspired by "sed" with its philosophy of editing a 
 text-stream. But sed uses single character commands which can add to its
 crypticness, so I decided to include English word command names for most 
 nom nom://commands . Each word was chosen to be expressive and to convey
 the sense of inverse operations, for example the operation pairs 
  nom://push and nom://pop  >> 
  nom://put and nom://get  >> 
  nom://clip and nom://clop  >> 

 are commands that (more or less) do the opposite of each other. So 
 *clip* removes one character from the end of the pep://workspace buffer
 and *clop* removes one character from the start of the workspace buffer.

 Most of the Nom commands also have a one character version if you want
 to write very terse, unreadable scripts.

### NOTES

 When naming each command, I tried to use a word which indicated
 tersely the effect that it has on the pep text-register virtual machine.
