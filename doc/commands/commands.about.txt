## doc/commands folder

  This folder contains documentation about the commands that 
  are available in the "Nom" language.
  
  An index of each command and a link to its documentation is 
  "here" file:///doc/commands/doc.dir.index.html

  The pep interpreter will provide a list of commands with the 
  *-c* switch and a short summary with the *-C* switch. Some of 
  the commands below are not in the format that they would
  actually be used in a script. For example *untiltape* is actually
  written as:

    >> until;  # read input stream until workspace ends with current cell

  * display all valid Nom commands with "pep -c"
  >> pep -c
  

   nom://add adds a given text to the workspace buffer >>
   nom://clip removes one character from the end of the workspace >>
   nom://clop removes one character from the beginning of the workspace >>
   nom://clear clears the workspace >>
   nom://replace replace one string with another in the workspace >>
   nom://upper converts all characters to uppercase in the workspace >>
   nom://lower converts all characters to lowercase in the workspace >>
   nom:cap First char in workspace uppercase, the rest lowercase >>
   nom:print prints the workspace to stdout >>
   nom:pop pops from the stack to the start of the workspace >>
   nom:push push (*) delimited token from start of the workspace to the stack >>
   nom:unstack pops entire stack onto the beginning of the workspace >>
   nom:stack pushes entire workspace onto the stack >>
   nom:put puts the workspace into the current tape cell >>
   nom:get Appends current tape cell to the workspace >>
   nom:swap swaps the current tape cell and the workspace >>
   nom:++ increments the current tape cell by one >>
   nom:-- decrements the current tape cell by one >>
   nom:mark marks the current tape cell with the given text >>
   nom:go sets the tape cell pointer to the marked cell >>
   nom:read read a character from the input stream >>
   nom:until reads the input stream until the workspace ends with given text >>
   nom:untiltape reads the input stream until the workspace ends with tape-cell text >>
   nom:while reads io while peek is something >>
   nom:whilenot reads io while peek is not something >>
   nom:count appends the value of the accumulator to the workspace >>
   nom:a+ increments the machine accumulator by one >>
   nom:a- decrements the accumulator by one >>
   nom:zero sets the numerical accumulator to zero >>
   nom:chars Appends number of characters read to end of workspace buffer >>
   nom:lines Appends number of lines read to end of workspace buffer >>
   nom:nochars Sets the character counter to zero >>
   nom:nolines Sets the line counter to zero >>
   nom:escape prefixes the given character with the escape character >>
   nom:unescape converts chars to unescaped equivalent >>
   nom:delim changes the stack token delimited to the given character >>
   nom:state prints the current state of the machine. >>
   nom:quit immediately exits the script >>
   nom:write writes the workspace to default file 'sav.pp' >>
   nom:writefile writes the workspace to a file >>
   nom:appendfile appends the workspace to a given file >>
