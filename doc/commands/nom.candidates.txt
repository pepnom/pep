## Nom candidate commands

  About commands that may be added to the nom language

  Often when I am writing a nom script I think to myself "It would
  be nice to have such-and-such command". But Usually I find a 
  way to achieve the functionality with existing commands.

  There is some value in deliberately limiting the commands that 
  are available for manipulating the pep machine: it forces the 
  script writer to treat the input as a language and not just 
  character-soup.

### A LIST OF CANDIDATE COMMANDS

  - replace "text";  this would replace the given text with the 
    contents of the current tape cell
  - esc 'c'; change the current escape character used by the 
    nom://escape and nom://unescape commands. This command is actually
    required and will be added when I get around to it.
  - eprint; print workspace to stderr not standard out.
