## THE NOM "PUT" COMMAND ....

 put the contents of the workspace into the current tape cell

 The put command places the entire contents of the workspace into the current
 pep://tape cell, overwriting any previous value which that cell might have
 had. The *put* command takes no parameters.

 * parse (or lex) alphabetic words and save with put 
 -----++
   read;
   [:alpha:] { 
     while [:alpha:]; put; 
     clear; add "word*"; push;
     .reparse
   }
   # delete/ignore everthing else
   !"" { clear; }
  parse>
   (eof) {
     # get a word and print in reverse
     pop; "word*" {
       clear; get; add " "; print; clear;
       .reparse
     }
     quit;
   }
 ,,,,

  * put the text "one" into the current tape cell and the next one.
  >>  clear; add "one"; put; ++; put; --;
 
 The put command only affects the current tape cell of the virtual
 machine. 

 After a put command the workspace buffer is *unchanged*. This contrasts with
 the nom nom://push command which pushes a certain amount of text (one parse
 token) from the pep://workspace onto the stack and deletes the same amount of
 text from the workspace buffer.

 The put command is the counterpart of the nom://get command which retrieves or
 gets the contents of the current item of the pep://tape data structure. Since the
 tape is generally designed for storing the values or the attributes of parse
 tokens, the put command is essentially designed to store values of
 attributes. However, the put command overwrites the contents of the 
 current tape cell, whereas the "get" command appends the contents of 
 the current tape cell to the work space.

 The put command can be used in conjunction with the 'increment' ++ and
 'decrement' -- commands to store values in the tape which are not the current
 tape item.
