## THE NOM "LINES" COMMAND

  Append the number of *lines* read to the workspace buffer

  The *lines* (or *ll*, it's original, cryptic name) command appends to the
  nom://workspace the current value of the line counter register. This is very
  useful when writing compilers/transpilers/tranlators etc in order to produce
  an error message with a line number when there is a syntax or format error in
  the input stream.

  * using "lines" in helpful error messages
  -------+
    read;
    [#@&!*] {
      clear; 
      add "! Gurgle syntax error: "; lines; add "\n";
      add "! The characters #,@,&,!,* are very bad. End of story.\n";
      add "! Go back to the drawing board. Goodbye. \n"; 
      print; quit;
    }
    clear;
  ,,,

### NOTES
 
  You can set the pep://lines register in the [pep] virtual machine to *zero*
  with the nom://nolines command but I dont use this very much.  The
  nom://chars command is analogous to the *line* command but is an automatic
  character counter. I find the nom://nochars command, which sets the
  pep://chars register to zero, to be more useful because it allows you to make
  the character counter relative to the start of the current line.

  * make the character counter relative to the start of the line

    read; [\n] { nochars; }
    "&" {
      put; clear; 
      add "! on line "; lines; add " (char "; chars; add ")\n";
      add "  you used an Ampersand(&). Please Dont. Thanks.\n";
      print; clear; quit;
    }
    clear;
