## THE NOM "ZERO" COMMAND 
         
  Set the [pep] *accumulator* register to *zero*

  The "zero" command sets the pep pep://machine *accumulator* or counter to
  zero. The accumulator register may be used for any purpose as seen fit by the
  intrepid linguist, for example for "counting" nom://count the number of words
  per line. For counting characters or lines it may be easier to use the 
  nom://lines command or the nom://chars command.
  
  * count words per line and display
  -------+
    while [\r\t\f ]; clear; 
    whilenot [:space:]; a+; add " "; print; clear;
    # print the line count after every line or at end of file
    while [\n]; 
    [\n],(eof) { 
      clear; add "(# words: "; count; add ")\n"; print;
      zero; clear;
    } 
    clear;
    (eof) { quit; }
