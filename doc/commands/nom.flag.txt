## The flag non command

 **note** This command will not be implemented. It is not necessary.

 The alternative to this command is to use one of the (top) pep://tape
 cells as a kind of *flag* and then use the nom://mark and nom://go 
 commands to access the flag. This is an alternative to using the 
 accumulator as a state variable.

 * using a tape cell as a flag
 -----+
   begin { mark "parse.state"; ++; }
   # .....
   # to access the flag
   clear; mark "here"; go "parse.state"; get; go "here";
   "in.comment" {
     # parse according to the current state
     # set the parse state
     clear; add "outside.comment"; mark "here"; go "parse.state";
     put; go "here"; clear;
   }
 ,,,,

 Set the *flag* register to the current text in the workspace.

 This command (and the register) have not been implemented in the 
 pep interpreter, nor in the /tr/ translation scripts.
