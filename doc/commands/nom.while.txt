## THE NOM "WHILE" COMMAND

  Read the input stream *while* the peep register contains the given
  *character class*

  The 'while' command in the pattern-parse language reads the input stream
  while the [pep] virtual machine pep://peep buffer is any one of the
  characters or character sets mentioned in the argument.  The command is
  written

   * an example while command
   >> while [cdef];

  The command takes one argument. This argument may also include character
  classes as well as literal characters.  From example,

   >> while [:space:];

  reads the input stream while the peep buffer is a space character
  The read characters are appended to the 'workspace' buffer.
  The while command cannot take a quoted argument ("xxx").

  Negation for the character class is currently supported 
  using the nom://whilenot command.

### Notes

  The while command is designed to be used mainly in the tokenising 
  phase of the nom script: that is, it consumes the input stream
  so that a new parse token can be created and nom://push ed onto 
  the parse pep://stack . And the corresponding text is nom://put
  into the pep://tape string array .


  The [:space:] class will match all white space including newlines.
  But [:blank:] should match all white-space except newlines. These
  classes should follow the rules of the ctype.h classes. When a nom
  script is translated to another language (for example: 
  [nom:translation.links] ) then these character classes should become
  *unicode-aware* if I dare use that term. But this may also depend 
  on the target language and my implementation of the translator for 
  that language.
