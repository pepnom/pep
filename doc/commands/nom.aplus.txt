## THE INCREMENT COUNTER "A+" COMMAND

 Increment the pep accumulator register by one.

 This command increments the machine counter variable by
 one. It is written *a+;* . The pep://accumulator register can also
 be decremented (by one) with the nom://a- command. To display the 
 current contents of the *accumulator* register, use the nom://count
 command, which appends the value of the counter (as text) to the end
 of the pep://workspace buffer. If you keep decrementing the counter 
 it will become negative. That's OK.

 The pep://tape commands nom://++ and nom://-- do not affect the 
 accumulator register. They are for incrementing and decrementing the 
 current tape cell.

 * count empty lines in a text file
 ----+
   # like: grep -c '^[[:space:]]*$' file.txt

   until "\n"; [:space:] { a+; }
   clear;
   (eof) {
     add "* found "; count; add " blank lines in "; lines; 
     add " lines of text.\n"; 
     print; quit;
   }
 ,,,

 The plus command takes no arguments. Its counter part is the
 nom://a- command. 

### NOTES

 The [pep] virtual pep://machine was designed to be as simple 
 as possible while being capable of parsing and transforming context
 free languages. Also, I wanted, as far as possible to make the [pep]
 machine completely *text-oriented* and **not** capable of performing
 calculations and other code functions. The reason for this was to 
 avoid embedding compilers and translators in code and thereby hide
 the language-to-language map features of compilers.

 However, it did seem useful to be able to count things, hence the 
 accumulator.
