## THE NOM "RESTART" COMMAND 

  *restart* the script from the beginning

  The ".restart" command makes the interpreter jump beginning of of the script,
  or just after the nomsyn://begin block if there is one.
  
  It is important to realise that the is 
  *an implicit .restart at the end of all nom scripts* . This behaviour
  mirrors the behaviour of [sed] and [awk] which also jump back to 
  the beginning of the script while there is more input to be nom://read

  The .restart command takes no arguments, and is **not** terminated with a
  semi-colon. I chose this syntax for .restart and .reparse because it 
  emphasises that the script execution does not continue past that point.

### NOTES

  In non parsing scripts such as the nom html pretty-printer 
  /eg/nom.tohtml.pss and the snippet pretty-printer /eg/nom.snippet.tohtml.pss
  this command is used instead of .reparse
  
  At the end of the input stream a .restart command will jump
  straight back to the 1st command after the nomsyn://begin block which
  is usually a nom://read command. In this case the script will 
  just silently exit because nom://read at the [eof] automatically 
  exits the script. This may not be what you want. The script below
  shows a pattern for trapping .restart commands at the end of the 
  input.

  * trap a .restart at the end of the input 
  -------+
    begin { add "hello"; print; clear; }
    (eof) {
      add "goodbye!"; print; quit;
    } 
    read;
    # ignore space and jump back to the start of the script
    [:space:] { clear; .restart }
    # do stuff here
