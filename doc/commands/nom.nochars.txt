## THE NOM "NOCHARS" COMMAND

  Set the automatic character counter register to zero (i.e. to *nochars*)

  Everytime that a character (Unicode we hope) is read from the input stream,
  (by the *nom* commands nom://read or nom://while or nom://whilenot or
  nom://until ) the character counter register in the pep virtual "machine"
  pep://machine is incremented by one. 
  
  The "nochars" command sets the automatic character counter to zero.  This is
  useful for making the character number relative to the line number. This is
  often more helpful than having a character count that starts from the
  beginning of the input stream.  For example at the beginning of a script, we
  can put

  * break lines that are longer than 40 characters
  ------+
    read; [\n] { nochars; } print; clear; 
    chars; "60" { clear; add "\n"; print; }
    clear;
  ,,,,

  * show the line and (line-relative) character number of 'z's in input
  -----+
    read; 
    "\n" { nochars; }
    "z" { 
      add "\n[Found a 'z' at line: "; lines; add ", char: "; chars;
      add "]\n";
    }
    print; clear;
  ,,,,,

### Notes

  The pep machine also has a built-in automatic line counting register
  called the pep://lines register. It is *automatic* because it is 
  automatically incremented every time a newline character is encountered
  in the input-stream. Like the pep://chars register it cannot be 
  decremented but it can be set = 0 with the nom://nolines command.

  The reason that these 2 registers exist (and are automatic) is that 
  pretty much every language compiler or "syntax checker" or data-format
  checker will try to provide a somewhat helpful error message when 
  an error is encountered in the source. That means, as far as possible,
  giving a line and (relative) character number as a pointer to where 
  the error occured.

  In recent nom scripts I have actually developed the technique of creating
  and nom://push ing an *error* token on the stack, and that token
  will print the message that is in the token "attribute" (stored in the
  corresponding cell of the machine pep://tape ) This avoid duplicating
  the line and character printing code in every error message.
