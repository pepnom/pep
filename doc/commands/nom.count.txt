## THE NOM "COUNT" COMMAND

 The count command adds the value of the counter variable to the end of the
 workspace buffer.
 
 For example, if the counter variable is 12 and the
 workspace contains the text 'line:', then after the *count* command the
 workspace will contain the text

  * print line numbers before each line
  >> read; [\n] { a+; count; add ": "; }  print; clear;

  * run the line-numberer with the pep interpreter
  >> pep -e "read; [\n] {a+; count; add ': '; } print;clear;" filename 

  * the same line-numberer with cryptic single char commands
  >> pep -e "r;[\n]{+;n;a': ';}t;d;" filename 

  * translate this one-liner to java, compile and run 
  -----
    pep -f tr/translate.java.pss \
      -e "read; [\n] {a+; count; add ': '; } print; clear;" > Machine.java
    javac Machine.java
    cat /usr/share/dict/words | java Machine

  note: it would be simpler to use the nom://lines command in this example

  * print line number before each line with "lines" command
  >> read; [\n] { lines; add ": "; } print; clear;
  
  * count the number of dots in the input 
  >> read; "." { a+; } clear; <eof> { count; print; }
   
 The count command only affects the 'workspace' buffer in the *Pep* virtual
 "machine" pep://machine . The *pep* machine also maintains an automatic
 count of the 
 
 For counting lines and characters in the
 input-stream, the commands nom://lines, chars", "nolines" and "nochars" exist.

  * count blank lines in input

    read; 
    "\n" { 
      while [ \t\r]; clear; 
      !(eof) { read; "\n" { a+; }}
    }
    clear;
    (eof) {
      add "Blank lines: "; count; add "\n";
      print; quit;
