## THE NOM DECREMENT ACCUMULATOR OR "A-" COMMAND
 
 *Decrement* the pep counter register by one.

 The [pep] virtual pep://machine has a very simple integer counter or
 *accumulator* register which can either count up, count down, be set to
 nom://zero or be appended to the pep://workspace buffer with the nom://count
 command.

 This command takes no arguments.

   clear;
   (eof) { 
     count; !"0" { add " un-"; }
     add "equal '{' and '}'\n"; print; quit;
   }
  ,,,

### NOTES

  The *(eof)* checks to see if the peep buffer contains the 
  end of input stream marker.
