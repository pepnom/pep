## THE NOM "PRINT" COMMAND

  *print* the contents of the workspace buffer to *stdout*

  The print command prints the contents of the pep://workspace to
  the standard output stream (the console, normally). This is
  analogous to the sed 'p' command (but its abbreviated form
  is 't' not 'p' because 'p' means "pop").

  * Print each character in the input stream twice:
  >> read; print; print; clear;

  * double space a file
  ----+
    read; [\n] { print; }
    print; clear;
  ,,,,

  note: the implicit 'loop' at the bottom of the script

  * Replace all 'a' chars with 'A's;
  >> read; "a" { clear; add "A"; } print; clear;

  * Only print text within double quotes:
  >> read; '"' { until '"'; print; } clear;
    
## NOTES
 
  The print command does not take any arguments or parameters.
  The print command is basically the way in which the parse-language
  communicates with the outside world and the way in which it
  generates an output stream. The print command does not change
  the state of the pep virtual machine in any way.

  Unlike sed, the *nom* language does not do any "default" printing.  That is,
  if the print command is not explicitly specified the script will not print
  anything and will silently exit as if it had no purpose. This should be
  compared with the default behavior of sed which will print each line of the
  input stream if the script writer does not specify otherwise (using the -n
  switch).

  Actually the print command is not to be so extensively used as 
  in sed. This is because if an input stream is successfully parsed
  by a given script then only *one* print statement will be necessary,
  at the end of the input stream. However the print command could be
  used to output progress or error messages or other things.
