## THE NOM "DELIM" COMMAND

 The *delim* command changes the nom parse token delimiter 
 to the given character. 
 
 Any character can be used for the parse token delimiter including spaces
 punctuation or any other character. It is a matter of personal preference.
 I like '*' which is why is it the default. The "pep" pep://machine
 virtual machine and the [nom] language are based on the idea that 
 
 * mjb, the inventor of nom
 """ Everything is text """

 Even zeros and ones are probably text if you are looking at them...
 But the significance of this is that *parse tokens* are also text, not
 some mysterious wp://abstract.syntax.tree or some other fancy data
 structure that I (and probably you) don't really understand. But you 
 understand *text* , correct? Well at least we think we do: its some kind
 of "ascii" https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html
 or "UTF8" wp://utf-8 or whatever encoding that is hopefully terribly
 Unicode in the nicest way.

 In *nom* you just build parse tokens like you would any other piece of 
 text and then nom://push them onto the pep://stack and leave them there
 until you need them again. Isn't that great? Its one of the strangely 
 simple but revolutionary ideas of *nom*. But I am digressing; lets get
 back to the *delim* command.

 * change the pep/nom delimiter to '.'
 ---+
   delim ".";
   delim '.';  # no difference
 ,,,

 The parse token delimiter governs how the nom://push and nom://pop
 commands work. If the delimiter is ',' and the pep://workspace buffer is 
 >> one,two,three,
 then, after a *push* command, the workspace will be 
 >> two,three,

 However, if we change the delimiter to a "." dot and then issue another 
 *push* command, then the whole workspace will be pushed onto the stack

 * changing the delimiter and pushing
 ------+
   # workspace is now "two,three,"
   delim "."; 
   push;
   # workspace is now "" (ie empty)
 ,,,

 The default (starting) parse token delimiter is '*' and normally you 
 would only change the delimiter once at the start of the *nom* script
 to suit your visual preference.

 * change the delimiter for the whole script
 -----+
  begin { delim '#'; }
  read;
  # write your script here
  (eof) {
    # do something when the end of the input 
    # stream is reached
  }
 ,,,,

 There is only one practical exception to this rule-of-thumb that I know
 of: To use the *delim* command as a hackish way to "split" the workspace
 string. 

 * a hack to split the workspace on a character using "delim"
 -----+
   "two words" {
     delim " "; push; 
     # workspace is now 'words'
     add "\n"; print; clear; 
     delim "*"; pop;
     add "\n"; print; clear; 
   }
 ,,,,

 The Nom language doesn't have any particularly fancy commands to work
 on the workspace buffer (and this was a deliberate choice for the sake
 of speed and simplicity), so sometimes it is necessary to resort 
 to hacks like the one above.


### NOTES 

 The *delimiter* register combined with the *pop* and *push* commands is a
 powerful way to manipulate grammar parse-tokens within a text-based virtual
 machine. It means that the same engine (pep) that is used to manipulate the
 token attributes is also used to manipulate the parse tokens, which results in
 a fast, simple and transparent parsing system
