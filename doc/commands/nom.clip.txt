## THE NOM "CLIP" COMMAND 
 
 *clip* one character from the **end** of the 'workspace' buffer
 (and send it into the void).
 
 It deletes it. The character is removed from the *end* of the workspace, and
 so, it represents the last character which would have been added to the
 workspace from a previous nom://read operation.

 The command is useful, for example, when parsing quoted text, used in
 conjunction with the 'until' command. The following script only prints
 text which is contained within double quote characters, from the input.

 * parse and print quoted text
 -----+
  read; '"' { clear; until '"'; clip; print; }
  "\"" { clear; until "\""; clip; print; }
 ,,,

 If the above script receives the text 'this "big" and "small" things'
 as its input, then the output will be 'big small' .That is, only
 that which is within double quotes will be printed.

The script above can be translated into plain English as follows

 a- If the workspace is a " character then
  - clear the workspace
  - read the input stream until the workspace -ends- in "
  - remove the last character from the workspace (the ")
  - print the workspace to the console
  - end if
  -

 The script should print the contents of the quoted text without the quote
 characters because the 'clear' and the clip commands got rid of them.
