## THE NOM "SWAP" COMMAND
  
  *Swap* the contents of the workspace buffer with the current tape cell

  Swaps the contents of the current tape-cell with the "workspace" buffer.
  The swap command allows the tape-cell to be added to the beginning of 
  the workspace, not the end, using the *swap* nom://get command 
  combination.

  The swap command is sometimes useful for 'juggling' the contents of 
  the pep://workspace with the current pep://tape cell. For example 
  if we need to compile the attribute for a new parse-token but at the 
  same time preserve the value of the original parse token (the parse
  token that is being "reduced"

  * prepend the current tape cell to the workspace buffer
  >> swap; get;

### NOTES

  All [nom] commands have a one letter abbreviation. For 
  *swap* the abbreviation is 'x'
