## THE NOM CHARS COMMAND

  append the number of characters read to the end of the pep://workspace buffer
 
 * print the total number of characters in the input 
 --------+
   read; 
   (eof) { 
     clear; add "read "; chars; add " characters.";
     print; 
   }

 The code above is almost equivalent to the unix *wc -c* command
 except that it will be a bit slower.   

 The chars command just does what it says on the box: it takes the value
 from the character counter in the pep virtual pep://machine and appends 
 it (as a string or text) to the *end* of the workspace buffer with 
 not intervening spaces. The point of this command is to point out to 
 the hapless user of your wonderful programming language or pattern 
 recogniser where he or she went so hopelessly wrong. Every compiler 
 or interpreter or simple syntax checker does this, and so should yours.

 But we need to *unpack* this a little. What is a "character"? 
 Can you alter the character counter? The first question is not trivial
 and possibly has no answer owing to a thing called unicode combining
 marks or "grapheme clusters". In a nutshell, a unicode "grapheme" (what
 we see on the page or screen as a single character) can consist of 
 a base character followed by *any number* of combining marks.

 But its ok, some of the nom "translators" /tr/ can handle grapheme 
 clusters. Well, actually at the moment on the "dart" /tr/nom.todart.pss
 translator. But the rust translator should be able to when it is 
 finished (getting there may 2025). 

 You can set the pep character counter to *zero* with the nom://nochars
 command but you cant do anything else to it, except print it. This 
 is one of these funny little artificial restrictions that I like to 
 place on the nom and pep virtual machine, with the idea of keeping 
 everything as simple as possible. One day you will see the wisdom
 of this.
