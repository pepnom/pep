## THE NOM STATE COMMAND

 Show the internal *state* of the [pep] pep://machine at the time
 that the command is issued.

### ABOUT 

 The *state* command displays the internal state of the pep virtual
 machine at the time that the command is executed. This is extremely
 useful for debugging and highly recommended. It even shows *coloured*
 output when executed from the [pep] interpreter.

 * a state command example
 ------+
   [:space:] { 
     while [:space:]; put; 
     clear; add "space*"; push; .reparse
   }
   ![:space:] { 
     whilenot [:space:]; put; 
     clear; add "word*"; push; .reparse 
   }
   clear;
  parse>
   pop;pop;pop;
   "word*space*word*","words*space*word*" {
     state; clear; add "words*"; push; .reparse
   }
   push;push;push;
   (eof) { quit; }

### NOTES

 Using the *state* command is basically a speedy version of invoking a script
 with the pep interactive debugger (using the '-I' switch) which is more
 powerful but a more laborious way to find out what is wrong with your script
 (or my coding). The interactive debugger allows you to step through the [nom]
 program one instruction at a time and view the nom://state of the pep
 pep://machine (it also has many other useful commands which may be useful for
 learning about the [pep] virtual machine ).
 
 * debug a script in interactive mode with the -I switch
 >> pep -Ie 'r;add "/";print;clear;' -i 'abcdef'

 The translation scripts at www.nomlang.org/tr implement the *state* command
 with a method on the class which is usually called printState() . This 
 is also a useful way to see if the translation scripts are working properly.
