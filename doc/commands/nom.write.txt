## THE NOM "WRITE" COMMAND

  Apparently this command writes the workspace to the file
  "sav.pp" I think that I initially implemented it with no 
  quoted parameter because the compiler script nomsf://compile.pss actually
  uses it in the process of compiling. 

### SEE ALSO

  - nom://writefile 
  - nothing else
