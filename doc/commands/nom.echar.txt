## THE NOM ECHAR COMMAND

 Change the escape character used by nom://escape and nom//unescape
 and also used by the nom://until command. The default escape character
 for all nom scripts is the backslash \\ but this can be changed 
 anywhere in the script with the *echar* command.

 * change the default escape character to "
 -------+
   begin { echar '"'; }
   read; '"' { until '"'; print; }  
   clear; 
 ,,,,
  
 In the script above, only text between quotes will be printed
 but the nom://until command will 'read past' doubled double quotes
 because it will regard them as 'escaped'.

## NOTES

 To tell the truth, I have never actually used this command in any 
 nom script. But I can think of plenty of times when it would be 
 necessary. Unfortunately, there are probably a number of languages and 
 formats where the escape character is actually multiple characters
 and the pep pep://machine is currently (sept 2025) unable to 
 accomodate this.
