## THE NOM "INCREMENT TAPE POINTER" OR "++" COMMAND 

 *Increment* the tape pointer by one .

 The command adds *one* to the "tape" pointer. The command is written
  >> ++ or >

 Note that the only part of the machine state which has changed is that the
 'tape-pointer' (the arrow in the 'tape' structure) has been incremented by one
 cell.
  
 This command allows the tape to be accessed as a pep://tape .  This is
 oed://tautological but true. Being able to increment and 'decrement' the tape
 pointer allows the script writer and the virtual machine to access any value
 on the tape using the 'get' and 'put' commands.
 
 It should be remembered that the 'push' command also automatically
 increments the tape pointer, in order to keep the tape pointer
 and the stack in synchronization.

 Since the "get" command is the only way to retrieve values from
 the tape the "++;" and "--;" commands are necessary. The tape
 cannot be accessed using some kind of array index because
 the get and 'put' commands to not have any arguments.

 An example, the following script will print the string associated
 with the "value" token.

 >> pop;pop; "field*value*" { ++; get; --; print; }
