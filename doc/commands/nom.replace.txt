## THE NOM "REPLACE" COMMAND ....

 This command replaces one string with another in the pep://workspace . The
 *replace* command is useful for indenting blocks of text during formatting
 operations, among other things. The replace command only replaces plain text
 strings, *not* regular expression patterns.

  * replace the letter 'a' with 'A' in the workspace buffer
  >> replace "a" "A";

  The replace command is often used for indenting generated code.

  * indent a block of text
  >> clear; get; replace "\n" "\n  "; put; clear;

  Replace can also be used to test if the workspace contains a particular
  character, in conjunction with the "(==)" tape test.

  * check if the workspace contains an 'x' 
  -----+
    # fragment 
    put; replace 'x' ''; 
    (==) {
      clear; add "no 'x'"; print; clear;
    }
