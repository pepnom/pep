## THE NOM "UNSTACK" COMMAND 

  Pop the entire stack as a prefix into the workspace. This command
  behaves exactly like multiple nom://pop commands until the pep://stack
  is completely empty. This means that the tape pointer is 
  decremented once for each parse-token that is popped off the stack.
  This behaviour applies to the pep interpreter and also to the 
  /tr/ "translation" scripts.
  
  This is useful for displaying the state of the stack at the end of
  parsing or when an error has occurred. I also use this command for 
  debugging after the nomsyn://parse> label.

  The code below is very handy for debugging the "grammar" wp://grammar of a 
  script because it shows you how that grammar tokens are reducing and 
  when (by line and character number of the input stream).

  * watch the parse stack reduce with line numbers 
  ----+

    add "line "; lines; add " char "; chars; add ": "; print; clear;
    unstack; print; stack; print; clear;
