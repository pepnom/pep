### See also

  The *nom* language only has a limited set of functions to manipulate
  the text in the workspace buffer (much more limited that the functions
  available [awk] or [sed] ) . 
  
  These functions are 
  nom://lower nom://upper nom://clip nom://clop nom://clear 
  nom://replace nom://cap nom://add

  
### Notes about unicode

  This command should be "unicode aware" but since the 
  *pep* interpreter is written in plain c, (with normal c *char* byte
  character type), scripts run through the interpreter will not be 
  unicode aware. This can be solved by running the script through one 
  of the *nom* "translation" nomsf://tr scripts.
