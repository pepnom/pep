## THE NOM "ESCAPE" COMMAND

  The *escape* command puts an escape character in front of all 
  occurences of the given character in the workspace buffer.

  It is possible that this command was made redundant by the 
  nom://replace command. I am not completely sure.

  * use the nom replace command to escape characters
  >> replace '"' '\"'; # or replace '"' '\\"';

  This is actually a tricky topic because each language may have 
  a different strategy for escaping characters.

  An important nom command for "tokenising"
  http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pjj/farrell/comp3.html the text input stream of a
  given *pattern* or formal)language (which could be a text data format like
  "JSON" www.json.org , "CSS" wp://css , a computer language like "lisp"
  www.lisp-lang.org or a simple pattern like a "palindrome" oed://palindrome )
  is the nom://until command. It reads the input stream *until* the 
  workspace buffer end in the given text, or else ends with the text that 
  is in the current pep://tape cell.

  But for this command to work properly it needs to be aware of 
  *escaped* characters. Lets take an example

  * parse quoted text
  -----+
    read; 
    '"' { 
      until '"'; put; clear; add "quoted*"; push; .reparse
    }
  ,,,
