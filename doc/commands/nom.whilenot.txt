## THE NOM "WHILENOT" COMMAND
  
  The *whilenot* command reads into the pep://workspace buffer characters from
  the input stream while the pep://peep buffer is *not* a certain character or
  characters. This is a "tokenizing" or "lexing" command and allows the input
  stream to be parsed up to a certain character without reading that character.

  The *whilenot* command does not exit if it reaches the end of the
  input-stream (unlike the nom://read command).

  * print one word per line
  >> r; [:space:] { d; } whilenot [:space:]; add "\n"; print; clear;

  * another way to print one word per line
  >> r; [ ] { while [ ]; clear; add "\n"; } print; clear;

  The advantage of the first example is that it allows the 
  script to tokenise the input stream into words

### NOTES

  The whilenot command cannot automatically ignore *escaped* characters
  like nom://until does.

  * a trap when parsing text with while
  ----+
    read;
    "'" { 
      # be aware that whilenot will stop at \\' and so
      # may not parse the whole profound utterance.
      whilenot "'"; put; clear;
      add "profound.utterance*";
      push; .reparse
    }
  ,,,

  The while, whilenot and nom://until commands will *not* exit to the operating
  system when they encounter the end-of-file or end-of-stream. This contrasts
  with the behavior of nom://read , which will exit the script loop.
  
  It is possible that the until command should also be able to take a 
  "class" nomsyn://classes argument so that multiple characters could be 
  used as an stop-condition for until.

### SEE ALSO 

 The following are all commands that read the input-stream.

  - nom://while read while the pep://peep register is the given class 
  - nom://until read until the workspace ends with the given text
  - nom://read read one character, codepoint or grapheme cluster.
