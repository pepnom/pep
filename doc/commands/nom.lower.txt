## THE NOM "LOWER" COMMAND 

  Make all text in the workspace buffer *lower* case. 
  
  The *lower* command is one of the few nom commands that manipulate
  the entire pep://workspace buffer at once. They include nom://replace
  nom://clear nom://upper nom://cap etc 

  * make all words "capital case" using upper and lower 
  ----+
    read; 
    [:space:] { while [:space:]; print; clear; }  
    ![:space:].!"" { 
      upper; print; clear;
      whilenot [:space:]; lower; print; clear;
    }

### NOTES ABOUT UNICODE

  This command should be "unicode aware" but since the *pep* interpreter is
  written in plain c, (with normal c *char* byte character type), scripts run
  through the interpreter will not be unicode aware. This can be solved by
  running the script through one of the *nom* "translation" nomsf://tr scripts.
