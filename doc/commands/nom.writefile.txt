## THE NOM "WRITEFILE" COMMAND

 writes the contents of the pep://workspace buffer to the given file. 

 I hardly ever use this command because it seems to be outside of 
 the scope of a parser parser or a compiler compiler. But it could 
 be useful

 * write the workspace contents to the file 'test.txt'
 >> writefile "test.txt";

 * write one line to "new.txt" 
 ----+
   clear; add "new.txt"; put; clear; until "\n"; writefile;
 ,,,

 I am not even sure if this syntax above exists, but it is very
 easy to implement in the interpreter and in the translation 
 scripts.

 I had actually forgotten completely about this command but 
 it is clearly useful. I presume this takes one parameter which is
 the filename. But their maybe another form, in which the file 
 name is taken from the current tape-cell.
