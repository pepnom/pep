## THE NOM "REPARSE" COMMAND 

  Jump to the *parse>* label in the script.

  The **.reparse** command combined with the nomsyn://parse> label
  is an important technique for ensuring that all grammar rules or 
  reductions will take place for a given parse token sequence.

  Unless you are convinced that a previous parse nomsyn://block will
  never be applicable, you should include a *.reparse* command in 
  every block where new grammar parse tokens are created and 
  "pushed" nom://push onto the [pep] pep://stack .

  The ".reparse" command makes the interpreter jump to the "parse>" label. The
  .reparse command takes no arguments, and is *not* terminated with a
  semi-colon. The .reparse command is important for ensuring that all
  shift-reductions occur at a particular phase of a script.
   
  If there is no 'parse>' label in the script, then it is a (compile-time)
  error to use the ".reparse" command.
