## THE NOM "DECREMENT" OR "--" COMMAND

 *Decrement* the tape pointer by one.

 The *--* command and the nom://++ (increment-tape-pointer) command are 
 very important for accessing the attributes associated with a particular
 parse token. A standard procedure during parsing is to "match" a 
 particular sequence of tokens, then access the text *attributes* for 
 each token to build a new text attribute (which will be associated with
 the new parse token that we are about to build) and then nom://put 
 the new attribute into the tape at the correct location.

  pop;
  "nounphrase*" { swap; add ": is a "; get; print; clear; }
  pop;pop;
  "article*adjective*noun*" {
    # build the new attribute from the old attributes
    clear; get; add " "; ++; get; add " "; ++; get; --; --; put;
    # create the new parse token and push onto the stack.
    clear; add "nounphrase*"; push; .reparse
  }
  push;push;push;

 The single character (cryptic) version of the *--* command is 
 *<* but you would only use it if you have some strange quota on 
 the number of characters you are allowed to use.

 If the current tape element is the first element of the tape then the tape
 pointer is not changed and the command has no effect. The tape pointer
 is also decremented by the "pop" command (if it is greater than zero).

### POP AND DECREMENT TAPE POINTER

 The nom://pop command performs an implicit *--* operation, *usually*
 (see below for the important oed://caveat ). This means that when you
 perform a *pop* on the [pep] machine pep://stack the pep://tape pointer 
 will be urbandict://automagically decremented and this is a marvellous
 thing, because it means that the *tape* and the *stack* tend to stay
 "in sync" with each other.

 The caveat which I mentioned above is that when the stack is empty, that
 is, it contains *no* parse tokens, then a pop operation will do 
 nothing. Since there is nothing to *pop* out of the stack, nothing will
 come out, but what is more, the tape pointer to the current tape cell
 will **not** be decremented (and this is also a stroke-of-genius if 
 I may say so myself).

 You will have already guessed that a very similar behaviour applies 
 to the nom://push command and the nom://++ (increment tape pointer) 
 command.
