## THE NOM "BAIL" COMMAND

  The *bail* command may be obsolete. Please dont use it (and it probably wouldn't
  work anyway). Use the nom://quit command instead. Let me explain: in a moment
  of obfuscation I thought that the pep,nom system should have 2 'quit' 
  commands, one for successful execution and one for 'error' conditions.
  So the nom://quit command would always return 0 and *bail* might return
  a non zero error code.

  But recently, I decided that the quit command could just return the 
  value in the accumulator as an exit-code. And that seemed like a good 
  solution - in fact I have implemented this in the pep interpreter and 
  in the translation scripts. 

  But writing this document, it occurs to me that 'bail' might still be 
  a good idea, using the pep://accumulator as the exit-code, because 
  the word *bail* makes it evident that an error condition has occurred
  and the quit command would always return 0.
