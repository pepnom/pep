## THE NOM NO OPERTION COMMAND

  The *nop* command which does nothing.

  It is strangely satisfying to include a command or operation 
  which does nothing. Maybe it is even mathematically necessary.
  In any case it exists in the nom language and does absolutely 
  nothing. Possibly I wanted to pretend the the pep pep://machine 
  is like a real logic machine which usually have a *no operation*
  command for reasons that escape me.

  * do nothing
  >> nop;

  The nom compiler nomsf//compile.pss does not permit empty 
  curly braces as a block because what would be the purpose of 
  that. But you can put a *nop* in the braces to make the 
  script compile if you insist.

### NOTES

  In the translation scripts this command is removed and replaced
  with a comment.
