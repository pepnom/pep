    && The Pep/Nom Parser and Script Language 

## AN OVERVIEW 

 A booklet about the pep/nom system (old).

 This booklet is about the pattern-parsing virtual machine and script
 language "nom". The executable file is /books/pars/pep and is compiled
 from the c source code "pep.c" /books/pars/object/pep.c
 
 The virtual machine and language allows simple "LR" bottom-up shift
 reduce parsers to be implemented in a limited script language with
 a syntax which is very similar to the "sed" unix stream editor.

 As far as I am aware, this is a new approach to parsing context-free
 languages and according to the scripts and tests so far written has 
 great potential. The script language is deliberately limited in 
 a number of ways (it does not have regular expressions, for example), but
 it seems to be an interesting tool for learning about compiler techniques.

DOCUMENTATION

 This file "pars-book.txt" is the principle documention about the
 pep/nom pattern-parser machine and language. This should also be available 
 as html at http://bumble.sf.net/books/pars/pars-book.html

 There is also a lot of documentation in the "pep.c" file (which implements
 the virtual machine) as well as in the "compile.pss" file, which converts
 scripts into machine assembler programs which can then be loaded by the
 pep tool. 
 
 Also, most example scripts in the /books/pars/eg/ folder also have
 notes at the beginning of the script.

ONE LINE EXAMPLES

  The pep tool may have useful applications in unix "one-liners" but
  its main power is in the implementation of simple context free 
  languages and compilers.

  * remove multiple consecutive instances of any character
  >> read; !(==) { put; print; } clear;

  * double space a text file
  >> pep -e "r;'\n'{a'\n';}t;d;" /usr/share/dict/words 
  >> pep -e "r;'\n'{t;}t;d;" /usr/share/dict/words # better
  
  * the same as above with long command names. 
  >> pep -e "read; '\n' { add '\n'; } print; clear;" someFile

  * print a string in reverse order
  >> read; get; put; clear; <eof> { get; print; }

  * convert tabs to 2 spaces 
  >> read; [\t]{d;a '  ';} t;d;

  * print all words which end with "ess".
  >> pep -e 'r; ![:space:] { whilenot [:space:]; [a-z].E"ess"{add "\n";t; }} d;' /usr/share/dict/words 

  * convert all whitespace (eg [ \r\n\t\f]) to dots
  >> read; [:space:] {d;a'.';} t;d;
  >> read; [:space:] {clear; add '.';} print; clear; 
  >> read; [ \r\b\t\f] {clear; add '.';} print; clear; 

 * double every instance of vowels   
 >> pep -e "read; [aeiou] { put; get; } print;clear;" -i "a tree"

 * Only print text within single quotes:
 >> read; "'" { until "'"; print; } clear;

 * remove multiple consecutive instances of the character "a":
 >> read; print; "a" { while [a]; } clear;

 * Number each line of the input:
 >> read; "\n" { lines; add " "; } print; clear;
 >> read; "\n" { lines; a " "; } t; d;  # the same, with short commands

 * Print the number of lines in the input stream
 >> read; (eof) { add "lines="; lines; add "\n"; print; }

 * the same using the accumulator
 >> read; "\n" { a+; } clear; (eof) { add "lines: "; count; print; }

 * Delete leading whitespace (spaces, tabs) from the start of each line: 
 >> read; print; "\n" { while [:space:]; } clear; 

 * print only lines containing "fox"
 >> r; E'\n',(eof) {put; replace "fox" ""; !(==) { swap; print; } clear; }

 * print only lines in input containing "fox" OR "dog"
 ----
  r; E'\n',(eof) {
    put; replace "dog" ""; replace "fox" ""; 
    !(==) { swap; print; } clear; 
  }
 ,,,

 * Delete whitespace from the input stream
 >> r; ![:space:] {print;} d;

 * insert 5 blank spaces at beginning of each line (make page offset):
 >> r; "\n" { add '     '; } print; clear;

 * print only the first ten lines of the input stream
 >> read; print; clear; lines; "10" {quit;} clear; 

 * Delete trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs) from end of each line: 
 ----------
   read;
   [ \t] { while [ \t\r]; read; E"\n" { clear; add "\n"; } }
   print; clear;
 ,,,

COMMAND LINE USAGE
  
  * specify script and input on the command line 
  ------
   pep -e "read; print; print; clear;" -i "abcXYZ"  
   # prints "aabbccXXYYZZ"
  ,,,,

  * load a script from file and start an interactive session to view/debug 
  >> pep -If scriptfile somefile.txt

  * load an "assembly" file into the machines program and view/debug. 
  >> pep -Ia asmfile somefile.pss

  * convert a script to compilable java code
  >> pep -f translate.java.pss script 

"TRANSFORMATIONS" AND COMPILATIONS

  The "pep" virtual machine and language is designed to either check the syntax
  of input or else transform one textual (data) format into another, or
  compile/transpile one context-free language into another.  

  Examples might be: 

  u/- transform a csv (comma-separated-values) file into a 
      json data format.
    - check if a string is a palindrome, or contains palindromes.
    - check the syntax of a DNS domain file.
    - Check if brackets and braces are "balanced".
    - check the syntax of a JSON text data file or convert to another format.
    - convert "markdown" text (or another plain-text format) into html or LaTeX
      See the script eg/mark.latex.pss for an example (that is the script
      that has generated the current document, with the help of 
      "pdflatex".
    - convert from "infix" arithmetic notation to "postfix" notation.
    - compile a (simple?) computer language into an assembly language.
    - properly indent a computer language source code file.
    - Analyse genetic sequences (possibly).

DEBUGGING

  The pep/nom virtual-machine is more complicated than the "sed" (the unix stream
  editor) virtual machine (sed only has 2 string registers, the
  "work-space" and the "hold-space"). So you may find yourself needing to
  debug a script. There are a number of ways to do this.

  * see how a particular script is compiled to "assembler" format
  >> pep -f compile.pss script

  The compiled script will be printed to stdout and saved in sav.pp
  or an error message will be displayed if the script has a syntax
  error.

  Sometimes the line above is useful for finding errors in a script
  which are not caught during the script loading process.

  * load a script and view/execute/step through it interactively 
  >> pep -If someScript input.txt

  If the script did not compile properly there will only be 1 
  instruction (quit).

  * interactively view how some script is being compiled by "asm.pp" 
  >> pep -Ia asm.pp someScript 
  >> pep -a asm.pp someScript 

  (Now you can step through the compiled program "asm.pp" and watch as 
  it parses and compiles "someScript". Generally, use "rr" to run the
  whole script, and "rrw text" to run the script until the workspace
  is some particular text. This helps to narrow down where the asm.pp
  compiler is not parsing the input script correctly.

  Once in an interactive "pep" session, there are many commands to 
  run and debug a script. For example:

  u/-
  -  n - execute the next instruction in the program
  -  m - view the state of the machine (stack/workspace/registers/tape/program)
  -  rrw <text> - run the script until the workspace is exactly some text.
  -  rre <text> - run script until the workspace ends with something
  -  rrc <num> - run script with <num> characters of input.
  -  rr  - run the whole script from the current instruction
  -  M.r - reset the virtual machine and input stream 
          (but not the compiled program)

GRAMMAR AND SCRIPT DEBUGGING ....

  Because pep/nom is a "filter" style system (which writes output to
  "stdout" ), we can print the stack and line/character number after
  each reduction and watch the grammar in action. This is a *very* useful
  technique for debugging grammars and scripts.

  The "print" statements are placed just after the "parse>" label.

  * visualise the stack token reductions with line/character numbers 
  ------
  parse>
    add "# "; lines; add ":"; chars; add " "; print; clear; 
    add "\n"; unstack; print; clip; stack; 
  ,,,

  The "less" program makes it possible to search for any particular token by
  name, to watch it being reduced. We can also seach by input line number.

  * watch token reduction and search for reductions 
  >> pep -f eg/script.pss file.txt | less

 * get a unique list of tokens used during parsing
 >> pep -f eg/mark.latex.simple.pss pars-book.txt | sed '/%% ---/q;' | sed 's/^[^:]*: *//;s/\* *$//' | tr '*' '\n' | sort | uniq


COMMON SCRIPT BUGS AND ERRORS....

  * make sure that you are pushing as many times as there are tokens.
  >> add "noun*verb*noun*"; push; push; # << error, 3 tokens, 2 pushes

  * in a block, if you "push" the tokens back, you need to .reparse
  ------
    "article*noun*" {
      clear; add "nounphrase*"; push; 
      # error! no '.reparse' command
    }
  ,,,,

  * make sure there is at least one read command in the script 
  >> "."{ clear; } print; clear; # << error: no read in script

  Two "pop" commands does not guarantee that there are 2 tokens 
  in the workspace. The stack may be empty, or may contain only 
  1 token.

  * check that the workspace has 2 tokens, and last is not a verb 
  ------
    pop; pop;
    B"noun*".!"noun*".!E"verb*" {
       # process tokens here.
    }
  ,,,,

  Often we expect a certain order of tokens, without realising that 
  an extra token has already been parsed and pushed onto the stack.

MORE SCRIPT EXAMPLES 

 * remove whitespace only at the beginning of the input stream
 >> begin { while [:space:]; clear; } read; print; clear;

 * print alphanumeric words in input stream one per line
 ----------------------
   read; [:alpha:] { while [:alpha:]; add "\n"; print; clear; }
   clear;
 ,,,

 * print assignments in the form abc:333 or val = 66
 ----------------------
   r; 
   ":","=" { add "*"; push; }
   [:alpha:] { 
     while [:alpha:]; put; clear; add "id*"; push; .reparse 
   }
   [0-9] {
     while [0-9]; put; clear; add "num*"; push; .reparse
   }
   !"" {d;}
 parse>
   pop; pop; pop;
   "id*:*num*", "id*=*num*" {
     clear;
     ++; ++; get; add " assigned to '"; --; --; get;
     add "'\n"; print; clear;
   }
   push; push; push;
 ,,,

 * print the number of alphabetical words in the input stream
 ---------------------
   read; [:alpha:] { while [:alpha:]; a+; } clear;
   (eof) { add "Words in file: "; count; add "\n"; print; clear; }
 ,,,

 * the classic fizzbuzz program 
 ----
   # untested
   lines;
   E"5",E"0" { clear; add "fizz"; print; }
   clear; count; 
   "3" { clear; add "buzz "; print; zero; }
   clear; until "\n"; print;
   a+
 ,,,

 * print words beginning with "www." as html links 
 ------
   read; 
   ![:space:] { 
     whilenot [:space:]; 
     B"www." { 
       put; clear; add "<a href='"; get; add "'>"; get; add "</a>";
       add "\n"; print; a+; 
     }
   } clear;
   (eof) { add "Http urls in file: "; count; add "\n"; print; clear; }

PEP VIRTUAL MACHINE DESCRIPTION

  The pep/nom parsing virtual-machine consists of a number of parts or registers
  which I will describe in the following subsections.

MACHINE ELEMENTS

  D/- stack:
      which can contain "parse tokens" if the language
      is used for parsing or any other text data.
    - workspace buffer:
      This is where all "text change" operations within the machine are 
      carried out. It is similar in concept to a register within
      a "cpu" or to the "sed" stream editor pattern space. 
      The workspace is affected by (almost?) all commands.
    - tape:
      Which is an array of text data which is synchronized with the 
      machine stack using a tape pointer. The tape is manipulated 
      with the "get", "put", and "swap" commands
    - tape-pointer or the current tape cell:
      This variable determines the current tape element (or "cell") which will
      be used by "get;" and "put;" commands. The tape pointer is incremented
      with the "++" command and decremented with the "--" command.
      This pointer register will also be incremented or decremented on a 
      successful "push" or "pop" command.
    - peep character register:
      This machine register is not directly manipulable. It contains
      the next character in the input stream (or "null" or "eof" if 
      the end-of-input has been reached). This register is used by the 
      "while" and "whilenot" commands, which read the input stream while
      the peep register satisfies a given condition.
    - counter:
      The counter or "accumulator" is an integer variable which can
      be incremented with the command "a+" , decremented with the 
      command "a-" , and set to zero with the command "zero" .
    - line counter:
      This register contains a count of the number of lines encountered
      so far in the input stream. It is automatically incremented when
      a "\n" character is encountered (but not a "\r" character). It
      can be set to zero with the "nolines" command.
    - character counter:
      This register contains a count of the number of (hopefully Unicode)
      characters encountered so far in the input stream. It is automatically
      incremented when with each character character. It can be set to zero
      with the "nochars" command.

WORKSPACE BUFFER ....

  The workspace buffer is the centre of the pep/nom virtual-machine and is 
  analogous to an "accumulator" register in a cpu chip. All incoming
  and outgoing text data is processed through the workspace. All machine
  instructions either affect or are affected by the state of the 
  workspace.

  The workspace buffer is a buffer within the virtual machine of 
  the stream parsing language. In this buffer all of the text
  transformation processed take place. For example, the commands
  clear, add, indent, newline all affect the text in the 
  workspace buffer.

  The workspace buffer is analogous to a processor register 
  in a non-virtual cpu. In order to manipulate a value, it is
  generally necessary to first load that value into a 
  cpu register. In the same way, in order to manipulate some 
  text in the pep machine, it is necessary to first
  load that text into the workspace buffer. This can be 
  achieve with the @get, @pop, @read commands.

STACK ....

  * machine instructions relating to the stack
  >> push, pop, stack, unstack

  The stack is used to store and access the parse tokens that are constructed
  by the virtual machine while parsing input.

** parse tokens

 Within the virtual machine of the pep/nom language the "stack"
 structure is designed to hold and contain the "parse tokens" 
 
 * Parse tokens can be any string ended by the delimiter eg:
 >> add "set*";

DELIMITER REGISTER ....

  The delimiter register determines what character will be used for 
  delimiting parse tokens on the stack when using the "push" and "pop"
  commands. This can be set with the "delim" command. The default
  parse-token delimiter is the '*' asterisk character.

  * set the parse token delimiter to '/'
  -------
    begin { delim '/'; }
    read; "(",")" { put; d; add "bracket/"; push; }  
  ,,,

  The delimiter character will often set in a 'begin' block.  I normally use
  the "*" character, but "/" or ";" might be good options. Apart from the
  parse-token delimiter character, any character (including spaces) may be used
  in parse tokens.

   * parse tokens with spaces 
   >> r; [A-Z] { while [A-Z]; put; add "\n"; print; d; add "cap word*"; push; }

FLAG REGISTER ....

  The flag register affects the operation of the conditional jump instructions
  "jumpfalse" and "jumptrue" and it is affected by the test instructions such
  as "testis", "testtape", "testeof" etc.  It is analogous to a "flags"
  register in a cpu, but (currently) it only contains one boolean (true/false)
  value.

  * machine assembler instructions relating to the flag register
  >> testis, testbegins, testends, testtape, testeof 
  >> jumptrue, jumpfalse

  The script writer does not read or write the machine flag register
  directly. It is set automatically by the testing instructions

ACCUMULATOR REGISTER ....

  The machine contains 1 integer accumulator register that can
  be incremented (with "a+"), decremented (with "a-") and set to
  zero (with "zero"). This register is useful for counting occurrences
  of miscellaneous elements that occur during parsing and translating.

  An example of the use of the accumulator register is given during the
  parsing of "quotesets" in old versions of the "compile.pss" script.  The
  accumulator in this case, keeps track of the target for true-jumps.

  * count how many "x" characters occur in the input stream
  >> r; 'x' {a+;} d; <eof> { add ' # of Xs == '; count; print; }
  
PEEP REGISTER  ....

  The peep buffer is a single character buffer which stores
  the next character in the input stream.  When a 'read' command
  is performed the current value of the peep buffer is appended to
  the 'workspace' buffer and the next character from the input
  stream is placed into the peep buffer.

  The "end-of-stream" tests <eof> <EOF> (eof) (EOF) check to see if the peep
  buffer contains the end of input stream marker. 

  The 'while' command reads from the input stream while the 
  peep buffer is, or is not, some set of characters
  For example
   >> while [abc];
  reads the input stream while the peep buffer is any one of the 
  characters 'abc'. 

TAPE ....

  * machine instructions with an effect on the tape
  >> get, put, ++, --, pop, push, mark, go

  The tape is an array of string cells (with memory allocated dynamically),
  each of which can be read or written, using the workspace buffer.
  The tape cell array also includes a tape cell pointer, which is usually
  called the "current cell". 

CURRENT CELL OF TAPE ARRAY ....

  * instructions affecting the current cell of the tape
  >> ++, --, push, pop, mark, go

  The current cell of the tape is a very important mechanism for storing
  attributes of parse tokens, and then manipulating those attributes. The
  pep virtual machine has the ability to "compile" or translate one text
  format into another. (I call this compilation because because the target
  text format may be an assembly language - for either a real or virtual
  machine)

  In the parsing phase of a script, the attributes of different parse tokens
  are accessed from the tape and combined and manipulated in the workspace
  buffer, and then stored again in the current cell of the tape. This means
  that a script which is transforming some input stream may finish with the
  entire transformed input in the 1st cell of the tape structure. The script
  can then print out the cell to <stdout> (with "get; print;", which allows
  further processing by other tools in the pipe chain) or else write the
  contents of the cell to the file 'sav.pp' (with "get; write;").

  The current cell is also affected by the stack machine commands 
  "pop" and "push". The push command increments the tape pointer 
  (current cell) by 1 and the pop command decrements the tape pointer 
  by one. 

  This is a simple but powerful mechanism that allows the tape pointer
  to stay in sync with the stack. After a "push" or "pop" command
  the tape pointer will be pointing at the correct tape cell for 
  that item on the stack. In some cases, it may be easiest to see how
  these mechanisms work by running the machine engine in interactive mode
  (pep -If script input) and stepping through a script or executing
  commands at the prompt.

  The tape pointer is also incremented and decremented by the 
  ++ and -- commands, and these commands are mainly used during the
  compilation phase to access and combine attributes to transform
  the input into the desired output.

SYNTAX OF THE PEP OR NOM SCRIPT LANGUAGE

  The script language, which is implemented in the file /pars/compile.pss
  has a syntax very similar to the "sed" stream editor. Unlike sed, it also
  allows long names for commands (eg "clear" instead of "d", "add" instead of
  "a"). Each command has a long and a short form.

  All commands must be terminated with a semicolon except for the following:
   >> .reparse .restart parse>

  White-space is not significant in the syntax of the parse-script 
  language, except within ' and " quote characters and square brackets []

  * random white-space
  -----
    read; !
    [a-e]{t;}

    d;
  ,,,,

  Braces "{" and "}" are used to define blocks of commands (as in
  sed, awk and c).

LANGUAGE FEATURES ....

  The script language (and its syntax) is implemented in the file
  compile.pss . Some commands, such as ".reparse" and ".restart" 
  affect the flow of the program, but not the virtual machine. 

  * tests on the workspace buffer, followed by a block of commands
  >> [a-z] { print; clear; }
   
  Most scripts start with "read;" or "r;" (which is the abbreviated
  equivalent). This reads one character from the input stream. Whereas sed
  and awk are line oriented (they process the input stream one line at a
  time), pep is character orientated (the input stream is processed one
  character at a time).

  As with sed and awk, pep scripts have an implicit loop. When the interpreter
  reaches the end of the script, it jumps back to the first command (usually
  "read") and continues looping until the input stream is finished. 

CHARACTER CLASSES ....

  Character classes are written [:space:] [:alnum:] etc. Currently (July
  2022), the c language implementation of the parse machine and language uses
  plain ctype.h character classes as a way of grouping characters.

  These classes are important in a Unicode setting because they allow
  specifying types of characters in a locale-neutral way.  The "while" and
  "whilenot" commands can use character classes as their argument.
  * check if the workspace is only alphanumeric characters 
  >> r; ![:alnum:] { add " not alpha-numeric! \n"; print; } clear;

  * read the input stream while the peep register is whitespace
  >> while [:space:];

QUOTES ....

  Both single and double quotes may be used in scripts and they
  have exactly the same role in the syntax of the pep/nom languages.
  But quoted text which starts with a double quote (") must end
  with a double quote, and the same rules applies to single quotes.

  * use single or double quotes in pep/nom scripts
  >> r; '"' { add "<< single quote!\n"; print; } d;

  If using the negation operator "!" in an "in-line" script, then
  enclose the whole thing in single quotes, so that the shell does
  not substitute the "!" character (or other special characters).

  * use single quotes in one-line pep scripts to avoid bash substitution 
  >> pep -e '![u-z],"/",";"{print;} clear;' -i "axbycz/;"

  Prints: abc/;

  The pep/nom language syntax allows quoted text to span more than one
  line. No special syntax is required and all special characters have the
  same meaning. This is mainly only useful as the argument to the 
  "add" command, in order to improve the readability of scrips

  * A multi-line quoted text example 
  ------
  begin { add '
    A multi-line 
    argument for "add".
    '; 
  } print; clear; quit;
  ,,,
  
  It is not necessary to have any space between a command and any
  quoted argument. This is because the pep/nom language knows how to 
  parse itself (see compile.pss for the gory details). In fact,
  "white-space" (\n\t\s\r\f) is not really significant anywhere in
  a pep/nom script - except within quotes.

  * no space is required before quotes
  -----
    read; add"."; # this is ok!
    replace"."".."; # this is be ok too.
    print;clear;
    # if the input is 'abc' this should print 'a..b..c..'
  ,,,

"ESCAPING" WITHIN QUOTES

  The until command automatically recognises "escaped" quote characters, so it
  will not stop reading the input stream when it encounters \\" or \\'

  * using single quotes, and some abbreviated commands
  >> r; 'a' { add 'A'; print; } d;

  Within quoted text, certain "escaped" characters have a special meaning.
  These characters have the same meaning in double and single quotes. 

  d/- \\n - represents a 'newline' character
    - \\r - a return character
    - \\f - a form feed (rarely used).
    - \\t - a tab

  * convert all tabs to 2 spaces in the input stream
  >> read; "\t" { clear; add "  "; } print; clear;
  
  * An abbreviated version of the above in-line pep/nom script
  >> r; "\t" { d; a "  "; } t;d;

  * create a "go" program, equivalent of the above script, compile and run
  -----
    pep -f tr/translate.go.pss -i 'r;"\t"{d;a"  ";}t;d;' > notabs.go
    go build -o notabs notabs.go
    echo -e "no\ttabs\tplease!" | notabs
    # should print 'no  tabs  please!'
  ,,,,

COMMENTS ....
   
  Both single line comments (line starting with "#"), or multiline
  comments (hash+asterix .... asterix+hash) are available. 

  Multiline comments are useful for disabling blocks of code
  during script development, as well as for long comments at the 
  beginning of a script.

BEGIN BLOCKS ....

  Like *awk*, the pep/nom language allows 'begin' blocks. These 
  blocks are only executed once, whereas the rest of the script
  is executed in a loop for every character in the input stream.

  * an example begin block and script
  -----
    begin {
      add "Starting script ...\n"; print; clear;
      # set the token delimiter to / 
      delim "/";  
    }
    read; print; clear;
  ,,,

  * create a basic html document 
  --------
    begin { add "<html><body><pre>\n"; print; clear; } 
    read; replace ">" "&gt;"; replace "<" "&lt;"; 
    print; clear;
    (eof) { add "\n</pre></body></pre>\n"; print; clear;}
  ,,,,


CONDITIONS AND TESTS .... 

CLASS TESTS ....

  The class test checks whether the workspace buffer matches any one of the
  characters or character classes listing between the square braces.  A class
  test is written.

    >> [character-class] { <commands>  }

  There are 3 forms of the character class test:
  o/- a list of characters eg: [abcxyz.,;]
    - a range of characters eg: [A-M]
    - a named character class eg: [:space:]

   * delete all vowels from the input stream using a list class test
   >> read; ![aeiou] { print; } clear;

  All characters in the workspace must match given class, so 
  that a class test is equivalent to the regular expression "^[abcd]+$"

  As in the previous example, class tests, like all other type of tests, can
  be negated with a prefixed "!" character. Double and multiple negation,
  such as "!!" or "!!!" is a syntax error (since it doesn't have 
  any purpose).

  * only print certain sequences 
  >> r; [abc-,] { while [abc-,]; print; } clear;

EOF END OF STREAM TEST ....
  
 This test returns true if the 'peep' look-ahead register currently contains
 the <EOF> end of stream marker for the input stream. This test is equivalent
 to the "END { ... }" block syntax in the AWK script language. The eof test is
 written as follows

  * possible formats for the "end-of-stream" test
  >> <eof> <EOF> (eof) (EOF)

  >> r; print; (eof) { add " << end of stream!"; } clear;

 This test can be combined with other tests either with AND
 logic or with OR logic
   
  * test if the input ends with "horse" when the end-of-stream is reached
  >> r; (eof).E"horse" { add ' and cart'; print; }

  * test if workspace ends with "horse" OR end-of-file has been reached 
  >> r; (eof),E"horse" { add " <horse OR end-of-file> "; print; } 
  
 The <eof> test is important for checking if the script has
 successfully parsed the input stream when the end of stream is
 reached. Usually this means checking for the "start token" or tokens of the 
 given grammar. 

  * check for a start token
  ------
    read;
    # ... more code
    (eof) {
      pop; 
      "statement*" {
         # successful parse
         quit;
      }
      # unsuccessful pase
    }
  ,,,,

TAPE TEST ....

  >> (==) { ...}

  This test determines if the current tape cell is equal to the 
  contents of the workspace buffer.

  * check if previous char the same as current
  ------
    read;  
    (==) {
      put; add ".same."; 
    }
    print; clear;
  ,,,,

BEGINS WITH TEST ....

  Determines if the workspace buffer begins with the given 
  text.

  * only print words beginning with "wh"
  >> read; E" ",E"\n",(eof) { B"wh" { print; } clear; } 

ENDS WITH TEST

  Tests if the workspace ends with the given text. The 'E'
  (ends-with modifier) can only be used with quoted text but
  not with class tests

  * a syntax error, using E with a class
  >> r; E[abcd] { print; } clear;

  * correct using the E modifier with quoted text
  >> r; E"less" { print; } clear;

  * only print words ending with "ess"
  >> read; E" ",E"\n" { clip; E"ess" { add " "; print; } clear; } 

CONCATENATING TESTS

  Conditional tests can be chained together with OR (,) or AND (.)

  * test if workspace starts with "http:" OR "ftp:"
  >> B"http:",B"ftp:" { print; }

  "AND" and "OR" test cannot be combined simply, but a similar thing
  can be achieved by nesting tests in braces. It may be useful to 
  add logic grouping for tests, eg: (B"a",B"b").E"z" { ... } however
  this is not currently supported.

  * an incorrect test
  >> B"a".E"z",E"x" { print; }   # wrong!

  * using nesting to combine "AND" and "OR" tests
  >> B"a",B"b" { E"z" { ... }}

  This line above is equivalent to the logic: 
  >> ((workspace BEGINS WITH "a") OR (workspace BEGINS WITH "b"))
  >> AND (workspace ENDS WITH "z")

  * print only urls 
  ----
   r; B"http://",B"https://",B"www.",B"ftp:" { 
     E" ",E"\n",(eof) { add "\n"; print; clear; }
   }
   E" ",E"\n",(eof) { clear; }
  ,,,

  * print only names of animals using OR logic concatenation
  ----
   read; [:space:] {d;} whilenot [:space:];
   "dog","cat","lion","puma","bear","emu" { add "\n"; print; }
   clear;
  ,,,

AND LOGIC CONCATENATION ....

  It is also possible to do AND logic concatenation with the "." operator

  * test if the workspace starts with 'a' AND ends with 'z'
  >> r; B"a".E"z" { print; clear; }

  * check if workspace is a url but not a ".txt" text file 
  >> B"http://".!E".txt" { add "<< non-text url"; print; clear; }

  * workspace begins with # and only contains digits and # 
  >> B"#".[#0123456789] { add " (timestamp?)\n"; print; }

  "AND" logic can also be achieved by nesting brace blocks. In some
  circumstances this may may have advantages.

  * and logic with nested braces
  ----
    B"/" { E".txt" { ... } }
  ,,,,

NEGATED TESTS ....

  The "!" not operator is used for negating tests.

  * examples of negated tests
  >> !B"abc", !E"xyz", ![a-z], !"abc" ...

STRUCTURE OF A SCRIPT

LEXICAL PHASE ....

  Like most systems which are designed to parse and compile context-free
  languages, parse scripts normally have 2 distinct phases: A "lexing" phase
  and a parse/compile/translate phase. This is shown by the separation of the
  Unix tools "lex" and "yacc" where lex performs the lexical analysis (which
  consists of the recognition and creation of lexical tokens), and yacc
  performs parsing and compilation of tokens.
   
  In the compile.pss program, as with many scripts that can be written
  in the parse language, the lexical and compilation phases are 
  combined into the same script. 

  In the first phase, the program performs lexical analysis of the input
  (which is an uncompiled script in the pep/nom language), and converts
  certain patterns into "tokens".  In this system, a "token" is just a string
  (text) terminated in an asterix (*) character. Asm.pp constructs these
  tokens by using the "add" machine instruction, which appends text to the
  workspace buffer.

  Next the parse token is "pushed" onto the "stack". I have quoted these
  words because the stack buffer is implemented as a string (char *) 
  buffer and "pushing" and "popping" the stack really just involves
  moving the workspace pointer back and forth between asterisk characters.

  I used this implementation because I thought that it would be fast and simple
  to implement in the "c" language. It also means that we don't have to worry
  about how much memory is allocated for the stack buffer or each of its items.
  As long as there is enough memory allocated for the workspace buffer (which
  is actually just the end of the stack buffer) there will be enough room for
  the stack.

  The lexical phase of "asm.pp" also involves preserving the "attribute"
  of the parse token. For example if we have some text such as
  "hannah" then our parse token may be "quoted.text*"
  and the attribute is the actual text between the quotes 'hannah'.
  The attribute is preserved on the machine tape data structure, which 
  is array of string cells (with no fixed size), in which data can
  be inserted at any point by using the tape pointer.

PARSING PHASE ....
  
  The parsing phase of the asm.pp compiler involves recognising and
  shift-reducing the token sequences that are on the machine "stack".
  These tokens are just strings post-delimited with the '*' character.
  Because the tokens are text, they popped onto the workspace buffer
  and then manipulated using the workspace text commands.
 
COMMANDS

  * view all commands supported by the pep/nom interpreter
  >> pep -C 

COMMAND SUMMARY ....
 
   All pep/nom commands have an abbreviated (one letter) form as well.

   - nochars
      sets the automatic character counter to zero.
   - print
      prints the contents of the workspace buffer to the standard 
      output stream (stdout).  Equivalent to the sed command 'p'
   - pop
      pops one token from the stack and adds it to the 
      -beginning- of the stack
   - push 
      pushes one token from the workspace onto the stack, or
      reads upto the first star "*" character in the @workspace buffer
      and pushes that section of the buffer onto the stack.
   - unstack
      pops the entire stack as a prefix onto the workspace buffer
   - stack
      pushes the entire workspace (regardless of any token delimiters
   -  in the workspace) onto the stack.
   - replace
      replaces a string in the workspace with another string. 
   - read
      reads one more character from the <stdin>.
   - state
      prints the current state of the virtual machine
      to the standard output stream. This maybe useful for debugging
      I may remove this command.
   - until 'text'
      reads characters from the input stream until the "workspace"
      ends in the given text. This can be used for "lexing"
      quoted strings etc. 
   - until; 
      reads characters from the input-stream until the "workspace"
      ends with the text contained in the current tape-cell.
      (this version of the until command is still being implemented)
   - cap
      converts the workspace to 'capital case' (first upper, then all lower)
   - lower
      converts all characters in the workspace to lowercase
   - upper
      converts all characters in the workspace to upper case.
   - while class/text;
      reads characters from the input stream while the 
      peep character is the given class 
   - whilenot class/text;
      reads characters from the input stream while the 
      peep register is *not* the given character or class
   - write
      saves the current contents of the workspace in the file
      "sav.pp"
   - write <filename>
      (over) writes the current contents of the workspace to the 
      file "filename".
   - append <filename>
      appends the contents of the workspace to the 
      file "filename".

"ADD" COMMAND ....
  
  The "add" command appends some text to the end of the 'workspace'
  buffer. No other register or buffer within the virtual machine is
  affected.  The command is written:
   >> add 'text'; #* or *#
   >> add "text";

  * add a quote after the ':' character
  >> r; [\:] { add "\""; } print; clear;  # non java fix!!
  >> r; [:] { add "\""; } print; clear; # java version

  But it shouldn't be necessary to escape ':'

  * The quoted argument may span more than one line. For example:
  ------
  begin { add '
      A multi-line 
      argument for "add".
    '; } read; print; clear;
  ,,,
  
  It is possible to use escaped characters such as \n \r \t \f or \" in 
  the quoted argument.

  * add a newline to the workspace after a full stop
  >> r; E"." { add "\n"; } print; clear;

  * Add a space after every character of the input 
  ----
    read; add ' '; print; clear;
    # or the same using abbreviated commands
    # r; a ' ';p;d;  
  ,,,
  
  "Add" is used to create new tokens and to modify the token attributes.

  * create and push (shift) a token using the "add" command
  --------
   "style*type*" {
     clear;
     add "command*";
     push;
   }
  ,,,,

  The script above does a shift-reduce operation while parsing some
  hypothetical language. The "add" command is used to add a new token name to
  the 'workspace' buffer which is then pushed onto the stack (using the 'push'
  operation, naturally). In the above script the text added can be seen to be
  a token name (as opposed to some other arbitrary piece of text) because it
  ends in the "*" character. Actually any character could be used to delimit
  the token names, put "*" is the default implementation. 

  The add command takes -one- and only one parameter, or argument.
  
"REPARSE" COMMAND  ....

  The ".reparse" command makes the interpreter jump to the "parse>" label. The
  .reparse command takes no arguments, and is *not* terminated with a
  semi-colon. The .reparse command is important for ensuring that all
  shift-reductions occur at a particular phase of a script.
   
  If there is no 'parse>' label in the script, then it is a (compile-time)
  error to use the ".reparse" command.

"CLIP" COMMAND ....
 
 The clip command removes one character from the end of the 'workspace' buffer
 and sends it into the void. It deletes it. The character is removed from the
 *end* of the workspace, and so, it represents the last character which would
 have been added to the workspace from a previous 'read' operation.

 The command is useful, for example, when parsing quoted text, used in
 conjunction with the 'until' command. The following script only prints
 text which is contained within double quote characters, from the input.

 * parse and print quoted text
 -----
  read; '"' { clear; until '"'; clip; print; }
  "\"" { clear; until "\""; clip; print; }
 ,,,

 If the above script receives the text 'this "big" and "small" things'
 as its input, then the output will be 'big small' .That is, only
 that which is within double quotes will be printed.

The script above can be translated into plain English as follows

 a- If the workspace is a " character then
  - clear the workspace
  - read the input stream until the workspace -ends- in "
  - remove the last character from the workspace (the ")
  - print the workspace to the console
  - end if
  -

 The script should print the contents of the quoted text
 without the quote characters because the 'clear' and
 the clip commands got rid of them. 

"CLOP" COMMAND ....

  The "clop" command removes one character from the front
  of the workspace buffer. The clop command is the counterpart of 
  the 'clip' command.

  * print only quoted words without the quotes
  >> r; '"' { until '"'; clip; clop; print; } clear;

"COUNT" COMMAND ....

 The count command adds the value of the counter variable
 to the end of the workspace buffer . For example, if the counter variable
 is 12 and the workspace contains the text 'line:', then after the 
 count command the workspace will contain the text
  >> line:12
 
 * count the number of dots in the input 
 >> read; "." { a+; } clear; <eof> { count; print; }
  
 The count command only affects the 'workspace' buffer in the virtual
 machine. For counting lines and characters in the input-stream,
 the commands "lines", "chars", "nolines" and "nochars" exist.

  * count blank lines in input
  ----
    read; 
    "\n" { 
      while [ \t\r]; clear; 
      !(eof) { read; "\n" { a+; }}
    }
    clear;
    (eof) {
      add "Blank lines: "; count; add "\n";
      print; quit;
    }
  ,,,,

"QUIT" COMMAND ....

  This command immediately exits out of the script without
  processing any more script commands or input stream characters.
  
  This command is similar to the "sed" command 'q'
  It would be useful for this command to provide an exit (or error)
  code. eg "quit 1;"

"DECREMENT" COMMAND ....

 The decrement command reduces the tape pointer by one and thereby moves the
 current 'tape' element one to the 'left' 
 
 The decrement command is written "--" or "<"

 If the current tape element is the first element of the tape then the tape
 pointer is not changed and the command has no effect. The tape pointer
 is also decremented by the "pop" command (if it is greater than zero).

"INCREMENT" COMMAND ....

 The command adds *one* to the "tape" pointer. The command is written
  >> ++ or >

 Notice that the only part of the machine state which has
 changed is that the 'tape-pointer' (the arrow in the 'tape' 
 structure) has been incremented by one cell.
  
 This command allows the tape to be accessed as a 'tape' . This is
 tautological but true. Being able to increment and 'decrement' the tape
 pointer allows the script writer and the virtual machine to access any value
 on the tape using the 'get' and 'put' commands.
 
 It should be remembered that the 'push' command also automatically
 increments the tape pointer, in order to keep the tape pointer
 and the stack in synchronization.

 Since the "get" command is the only way to retrieve values from
 the tape the "++;" and "--;" commands are necessary. The tape
 cannot be accessed using some kind of array index because
 the get and 'put' commands to not have any arguments.

 An example, the following script will print the string associated
 with the "value" token.

 >> pop;pop; "field*value*" { ++; get; --; print; }

"MARK" COMMAND ....
 
 The mark command adds a text "tag" to the current tape-cell.
 This allows the tape-cell to be accessed later in the script with
 the "go" command. The mark and go commands should allow "offside"
 or indent parsing (such as for the python language)

 * use mark and go to use the 1st tape cell as a buffer.
 ------
   begin { mark "topcell"; ++; }
   read; [:space:] { d; }
   whilenot [:space:]; put; 
   # create a list of urls in the 1st tapecell
   B"http:" {
     mark "here"; go "topcell"; add " "; get; put; go "here";
   }
   clear; add "word*"; push; 
   <eof> { go "topcell"; get; print; quit; }
 ,,,,

 See the script pars/eg/markdown.toc.pss for an example of using
 the "mark" and "go" commands to create a table of contents for 
 a document from markdown-style underline headings.

"GO" COMMAND ....

  The "go" command set the current tape cell pointer to a cell
  which has previously been marked with a "mark" command (using
  a text tag. The go/mark commands may be useful for offside
  parsing as well as for assembling, for example, a table of contents
  for a document, while parsing the document structure.

  * basic usage
  >>  read; mark "a"; ++; go "a"; put; clear;

"MINUS" COUNTER COMMAND ....
 
 The minus command decreases the counter variable by one.
 This command takes no arguments and is written
  >> a-;

  The 'testeof' (eof) checks to see if the peep buffer contains the 
  end of input stream marker. 

  The 'while' command reads from the input stream while the 
  peep buffer is or is not some set of characters
  For example
   >> while 'abc';
  reads the input stream while the peep buffer is any one of the 
  characters 'abc'. 

"PLUS" COUNTER COMMAND ....

 This command increments the machine counter variable by
 one. It is written
  >> a+ 

 The plus command takes no arguments. Its counter part is the
 'minus' command.

"ZERO" COMMAND ....
         
  The "zero" command sets the internal counter to zero.  This counter may be
  used to keep track of nesting during parsing processes, or used by other
  mundane purposes such as numbering lines or instances of a particular string
  or pattern.

  * 
  >> read; "x" { zero; } 

"CHARS" COMMAND ....

  The "chars" (or "cc") command appends the value of the current 
  character counter to the workspace register.

  * show an error message with a character number
  ----
    read; 
    [@#$%^&] {
      put; clear; 
      add "illegal character ("; get; ") ";
      add "at character number "; chars; add ".\n";
      print; clear;
    }
  ,,,,

  I originally named this command "cc" but prefer the longer 
  form "chars". 

"NOCHARS" COMMAND ....

  The "nochars" command sets the automatic character counter to zero.
  This is useful for making the character number relative to the line
  number. For example at the beginning of a script, we can put

  * show the line and character number of 'z's in input
  -----
    read; 
    "\n" { nochars; }
    "z" { 
      add "\n[Found a 'z' at line: "; lines; add ", char: "; chars;
      add "]\n";
    }
    print; clear;
  ,,,,,


"LINES" COMMAND ....

  The "lines" (or "ll", it's original, cryptic name) command appends to the
  workspace the current value of the line counter register. This is very useful
  when writing compilers in order to produce an error message with a line
  number when there is a syntax error in the input stream.

  * using "lines" in error messages
  -------
    (eof) {
      clear; 
      add "Unexpected end-of-file at line: "; lines;
      add " of input.";
      print; quit;
    }
  ,,,

"NOLINES" COMMAND ....

  Sets the line number character counter to zero.

  * make line numbers relative to current paragraph
  ----
    read; 
    # find empty lines
    "\n" { while [ \t\n]; E"\n".!"\n" { nolines; } }
  ,,,,

"UNSTACK" COMMAND ....

  Pop the entire stack as a prefix onto the workspace. This may be 
  useful for displaying the state of the stack at the end of 
  parsing or when an error has occurred. Currently (Aug 2019) the 
  tape pointer is not affected by this command.

"STACK" COMMAND ....

  Push the entire workspace onto the stack regardless of token
  delimiters.

"PUSH" COMMAND ....

  The "push" command pushes one token from (the beginning of) the 
  workspace onto the stack.

"POP" COMMAND ....

  The "pop" command pops the last item from the virtual-machine stack
  and places its contents, without modification, at the *beginning*
  of the workspace buffer, and decrements the tape pointer. If the 
  stack is empty, then the "pop" command does nothing (and the tape
  pointer is unchanged).
  
   * pop the stack onto the beginning of the workspace.
   >> pop;

   * apply a 2 token grammar rule (a shift-reduction).
   >> pop;pop; "word*colon*" { clear; add 'command*'; push; }

  The pop command is usually employed in the parsing phase 
  of the script (not the "lexing" phase); that is, after the "parse>"
  label. The "pop;" command is almost the inverse machine operation
  of the "push;" command, but it is important to realise that 
  a command sequence of "pop;push;" is not equivalent to
  "nop;" (no-operation).
   
  If the pep/nom parser language is being used to parse and translate a
  language then the script writer needs to ensure that each token ends with a
  delimiter character (by default "*") in order for the push and pop commands
  to work correctly.

  The pop command also affects the "tape" of the virtual machine in that the
  tape-pointer is automatically decremented by one once for each pop command.
  This is convenient because it means that the tape pointer will be pointing to
  the corresponding element for the token. In other words in the context of
  parsing and compiling a "formal language" the tape will be pointing to the
  "value" or "attribute" for the token which is currently in the workspace.

"PRINT" COMMAND ....

  The print command prints the contents of the workspace to
  the standard output stream (the console, normally). This is
  analogous to the sed 'p' command (but its abbreviated form
  is 't' not 'p' because 'p' means "pop".

** Examples

  * Print each character in the input stream twice:
  >> read; print; print; clear;

  * Replace all 'a' chars with 'A's;
  >> read; "a" { clear; add "A"; } print; clear;

  * Only print text within double quotes:
  >> read; '"' { until '"'; print; } clear;
    
** Details  
 
  The print command does not take any arguments or parameters.
  The print command is basically the way in which the parse-language
  communicates with the outside world and the way in which it
  generates an output stream. The print command does not change
  the state of the pep virtual machine in any way.

  Unlike sed, the parse-language does not do any "default" printing.
  That is, if the print command is not explicitly specified the 
  script will not print anything and will silently exit as if it
  had no purpose. This should be compared with the default 
  behavior of sed which will print each line of the input stream if 
  the script writer does not specify otherwise (using the -n switch).

  Actually the print command is not to be so extensively used as 
  in sed. This is because if an input stream is successfully parsed
  by a given script then only -one- print statement will be necessary,
  at the end of the input stream. However the print command could be
  used to output progress or error messages or other things. 
 

"GET" COMMAND ....

  This command obtains the value in the current 'tape' cell
  and adds it (appends it) to the end of the 'workspace' buffer.
  The "get" command only affects the 'workspace' buffer of the virtual
  machine. 

  * if the workspace has the "noun" token, get its value and print it.
  >> "noun*" { clear; get; print; clear; }

"PUT" COMMAND ....

 The put command places the entire contents of the workspace
 into the current tape cell, overwriting any previous value
 which that cell might have had. The command is written
  >> put;

  * put the text "one" into the current tape cell and the next one.
  >>  clear; add "one"; put; ++; put;
 
 The put command only affects the current tape cell of the virtual
 machine. 

 After a put command the workspace buffer is -unchanged- . This contrasts
 with the machine stack 'push' command which pushes a certain amount of text
 (one token) from the workspace onto the stack and deletes the same amount of
 text from the workspace buffer.

 The put command is the counterpart of the 'get' command which retrieves or
 gets the contents of the current item of the tape data structure. Since the
 tape is generally designed for storing the values or the attributes of parse
 tokens, the put command is essentially designed to store values of
 attributes. However, the put command overwrites the contents of the 
 current tape cell, whereas the "get" command appends the contents of 
 the current tape cell to the work space.

 The put command can be used in conjunction with the 'increment' ++ and
 'decrement' -- commands to store values in the tape which are not the current
 tape item. 

"SWAP" COMMAND ....
  
  Syntax: swap;
  Abbreviation: 'x' 

  Swaps the contents of the current tape-cell with the "workspace" buffer.
  The swap command allows the tape-cell to be added to the beginning of 
  the workspace, not the end.

  * prepend the current tape cell to the workspace buffer
  >> swap; get;

"READ" COMMAND ....
  
  The read command reads one character from the input stream and places that
  character in the 'peep' buffer.  The character which was in the peep
  buffer is added to the end of the 'workspace' buffer. 

  The read command is the fundamental mechanism by which the input stream is
  "tokenized", which is also known as "lexical analysis". The commands which
  also perform tokenisation are "until", "while" and "whilenot".  These
  commands perform implicit "read" operations.

  There is no implicit read command at the beginning of a script (unlike
  "sed" ), so all scripts will probably need at least one read command.

"REPLACE" COMMAND ....

 This command replaces one piece of text with another in the workspace. The
 "replace" command is useful for indenting blocks of text during formatting
 operations, among other things. The replace command only replaces plain text,
 not regular expression patterns.

  * replace the letter 'a' with 'A' in the workspace buffer
  >> replace "a" "A";

  The replace command is often used for indenting generated code.

  * indent a block of text
  >> clear; get; replace "\n" "\n  "; put; clear;

  Replace can also be used to test if the workspace contains a particular
  character, in conjunction with the "(==)" tape test.

  * check if the workspace contains an 'x' 
  -----
    # fragment 
    put; replace 'x' ''; 
    (==) {
      clear; add "no 'x'"; print; clear;
    } 
  ,,,,

UNTIL COMMAND ....

  * example
  >> until 'text';

  Reads the input stream until the workspace ends with the given
  text.

  * print any text that occurs between '<' and '>' characters
  >> /</ { until ">"; print; } clear;

  * print only text between quote characters (excluding the quotes)
  >> r; '"' { until '"'; clip; clop; print; } clear;

  * create a parse token 'quoted' from quoted text
  >> r; '/' { until '"'; clip; clop; put; add 'quoted*'; push; } clear;

  * print quoted text, reading past escaped quotes (\")
  >> /"/ { until '"'; print; } clear;

  The 'while' and 'whilenot' commands are similar to the until
  command but they depend on the value of the 'peep' virtual
  machine buffer (which is a single-character buffer) rather than
  on the contents of the 'workspace' buffer like the until command.

** notes

  The 'until' command usually will form part of the 'lexing' phase
  of a script. That is, the until command permits the script to 
  turn text patterns into 'tokens'. While in traditional parsing tools
  (such as Lex and Yacc) the lexing and parsing phases are carried out
  by separate tools, with the 'pep' tool the two functions are combined.
  
  The until command essentially performs
  multiple read operations or commands and after each read checks to see
  whether the workspace meets the criteria specified in the argument.

WHILENOT COMMAND ....
  
  It reads into the workspace characters from the input stream -while- the
  'peep' buffer is -not- a certain character. This is a "tokenizing" command
  and allows the input stream to be parsed up to a certain character without
  reading that character.

  The whilenot command does not exit if it reaches the end of the
  input-stream (unlike 'read').

  * print one word per line
  >> r; [:space:] { d; } whilenot [:space:]; add "\n"; print; clear;

  (there seems to be a bug in pep with whilenot "x" syntax)

  * whilenot can also take a single character quote argument
  >> r; whilenot [z]; add "\n"; print; clear;

  * another way to print one word per line
  >> r; [ ] { while [ ]; clear; add "\n"; } print; clear;

  The advantage of the first example is that it allows the 
  script to tokenise the input stream into words

WHILE COMMAND ....

  The 'while' command in the pattern-parse language reads the 
  input stream while the 'peep' buffer is any one of the 
  characters or character sets mentioned in the argument.
  The command is written

   >> while [cdef];

  The command takes one argument. This argument may also
  include character classes as well as literal characters.
  From example,

   >> while [:space:];

  reads the input stream while the peep buffer is a digit.
  The read characters are appended to the 'workspace' buffer.
  The while command cannot take a quoted argument ("xxx").

  Negation for the while command is currently supported 
  using the "whilenot" command.

ENDSWITH TEST .... 

  The 'ends with' test checks whether the workspace ends
  with a given string. This test is written
   
   >> E"xyz" { ... }

 The script language contains a structure to perform a 
 test based on the content of the workspace and to
 execute commands depending on the result of that test.
 An example of the syntax is

  >> "ocean" { add " blue"; print; }

 In the script above, if the workspace buffer is the text "ocean" then the
 commands within the braces are executed and if not, then not. The test
 structure is a simple string equivalence test, there are -no- regular
 expressions and the workspace buffer must be -exactly- the text which is
 written between the // characters or else the test will fail, or return
 false, and the commands within the braces will not be executed.

 This command is clearly influenced by the "sed" http://sed.sf.net
 stream editor command which has a virtually identical syntax
 except for some key elements. In sed regular expressions are 
 supported and in sed the first opening brace must be on the 
 same line as the test structure.

 There is also another test structure in the script language 
 which checks to see if the workspace buffer -begins- with the 
 given text and the syntax looks like this
  >> B"ocean" { add ' blue'; print; }

USING TESTS IN THE PEP TOOL
 
TEST EXAMPLES ....

  * if the workspace is not empty, add a dot to the end of the workspace
  >> !"" { add '.'; }

  * if the end of the input stream is reached print the message "end of file"
  >> <eof> { add "end of file"; print; }

  * if the workspace begins with 't' trim a character from the end
  >> B"t" { clip; }

TAPE TEST ....

 The tape test determines if the current element of the tape structure is the
 same as the workspace buffer.

 The tape test is written
  >> <==>

 This test was included originally in order to parse the sed structure
   >> s@old@new@g  or s/old/new/g or s%old%new%g
 In other words, in sed, any character can be used to delimit the 
 text in a substitute command.

ACCUMULATOR 

STACK STRUCTURE IN THE VIRTUAL MACHINE   

  The 'virtual'-machine of the pep language contains
  a stack structure which is primarily intended to hold
  the parse tokens during the parsing and transformation
  of a text pattern or language. However, the stack 
  could hold any other string data.  Each element of the
  stack structure is a string buffer of unlimited size. 

  The stack is manipulated using the pop and push commands.
  When a value is popped off the stack, that value is appended
  to the -front- of the workspace buffer. If the stack is 
  empty, then the pop command has no effect.

TAPE IN THE PEP MACHINE 

 The tape structure in the virtual machine is an infinite
 array of elements. Each of these elements is a string buffer
 of infinite size. The elements of the tape structure may be 
 accessed using the @increment , @decrement , @get and @put
 commands. 

TAPE AND THE STACK ....

 The tape structure in the virtual machine and the @stack
 structure and designed to be used in tandem, and several
 mechanisms have been provided to enable this. For example,
 when a "pop" operation is performed, the @tape-pointer is
 automatically decremented, and when a @push operation is
 performed then the tape pointer is automatically incremented.

 Since the parsing language and machine have been designed
 to carry out parsing and transformation operations on
 text streams, the tape and stack are intended to hold
 the values and tokens of the parsing process.
 
BACKUSNAUR FORM AND THE PATTERN PARSER

  Backus-naur form is a way of expressing grammar rules for formal languages.
  A variation of BNF is "EBNF" which modifies slightly the syntax of bnf.
  Sometimes on this site I use (yet another) syntax for bnf or ebnf rules but
  the idea is the same. 

  There is close relationship between the syntax of the 'pep' language
  and a BNF grammar. For example

  >>  "word*colon*" { clear; add 'command*'; push }

  corresponds to the grammar rule

  >> command := word colon

  * bnf rule written in pep/nom
  ----
   # lines: lines line 
   #        | line
   #        ;
   # or in "ebnf" format
   # lines: line+ ;
   until "\n"; put; clear; add "line*"; push;
   parse>
   pop; pop;
   "line*line*","lines*line*" 
     { clear; add "lines*"; push; .reparse }
  ,,,,

SIMPLE LANGUAGES 

  eg brainf***

SELF REFERENTIALITY

  The pep/nom language is a language which is designed to 
  parse/compile/translate languages. This means that it can 
  recognise/parse/compile, and translate itself. The script 
  books/pars/translate.c.pss is an example of this.

  Another interesting application of this self-referentiality
  is creating a new compiling system in a different target language.
    
REFLECTION SELF HOSTING AND SELF PARSING

  The script "compile.pss" is a parse-script which implements the 
  parse-script language. This was achieved by first writing a hand-coded
  "assembler" program for the machine (contained in the file "asm.pp").
  Once a working asm.pp program implemented a basic syntax for the language,
  the compile.pss script was written. This makes it possible to maintain and
  add new syntax to the language using the language itself.

  A new "asm.pp" file is generated by running 
     >> pep -f compile.pss compile.pss >> asm.new.pp; cp asm.new.pp asm.pp

  Finally it is necessary to comment out the 2 "print" commands near 
  the end of the "asm.pp" file which are labelled ":remove:"

  The command above runs the script compile.pss and also uses compile.pss as
  its text input stream. In this sense the system is "self-hosting" and
  "self-parsing".  It is also a good idea to preserve the old copy of asm.pp
  in case there are errors in the new compiler. 

SED THE STREAM EDITOR 

 The concept of "cycles" is drawn directly from  the sed
 language or tool (sed is a Unix utility). In the sed language
 each statement in a sed script is executed once for each -line-
 in a given input stream. In other words there is a kind of
 implicit "loop" which goes around the sed script. This loop in some
 fictional programming language might look like:

 * pseudo
 -----
  while more input lines
  do
    sed script
  loop
 ,,,

 In the current parse-language the cycles are executed for each 
 -character- in the input stream (as opposed to line).
 
SHIFTING AND REDUCING

 There is one complicating factor which is the concept of multiple
 shift-reduces during the "shift-reduce parsing  one cycle or the
 interpreter. This concept has already been treated within the @flag command
 documentation. Another tricky concept is grammar rule precedence, in other
 words, which grammar rule shift-reduction should be applied first or with
 greater precedence. In terms of any concrete application the order of the
 script statements determines precedence.
 
SHIFT REDUCTIONS ON THE STACK ....

  * see the following script fragment 
  ----
    pop;pop;
    "command*command*",
    "commandset*command*" { 
      clear; add 'commandset*'; push;
    }
    "word*colon*" {
      clear; add 'command*'; push; 
    }      
    push; push;
  ,,,

  This script corresponds directly to the (e)bnf grammar rules

  ---
    commandset := command , command;
    commandset := commandset , command;
    command := word , colon;
  ,,,,

  But in the script above there is a problem; that the first rule
  needs to be applied after the second rule.

  But it seems now that another reduction should occur namely
   >> if-block --> if-statement block
  
  which can be simply implemented in the language using the 
  statements:

  -----
    pop; pop;
    "if-statements*block*" { clear; add "if-block*"; push; }
  ,,,,

  But the crucial question is, what happens if the statements just written
  come before the statements which were presented earlier on? The problem is
  that the second reduction will not occur because the script has already
  passed the relevant statements. This problem is solved by the 
  .reparse command and the parse> label

PARSE TOKENS 

LITERAL TOKENS ....

  One trick in the pep/nom language is to use a "terminal"
  character as its own parse-token. This simplifies the lexing phase
  of the script. The procedure is just to read the terminal symbol
  (one or more characters) and then add the token delimiter character
  on the end.

   * using literal tokens with the default token delimiter '*'
   -----
     read; 
     "{","}","(",")","=" {
       put; add "*"; push; .reparse
     }
   ,,,

PURPOSE OF THE LANGUAGE AND VIRTUAL MACHINE

 The language is designed to allow the simple creation of parsers and
 translators, without the necessity to become involved in the complexities of
 something like Lex or Yacc. Since the interpreter for the language is based
 on a virtual machine, the language is platform independent and has a level
 of abstraction.

 The language combines the features of a tokenizer and parser and
 translator.

AVAILABLE IMPLEMENTATIONS 

 http://bumble.sourceforge.net/books/pars/object/
   This folder contains a working implementation in the c language.
   The code can be compiled with the bash functions in the file 
   "helpers.pars.sh"
 
COMPARISON BETWEEN PEP AND SED 

 The pep tool was largely inspired by the "sed" stream editor, both its
 capabilities and limitations. Sed is a program designed to find and replace
 patterns in text files. The patterns which Sed replaces are "regular
 expressions". Pep has many similarities with sed, both in the syntax of
 its scripts and also the underlying concepts. To better understand pep, 
 it may be useful to analyse these similarities and differences.

SIMILARITIES ....

  * The workspace:
    Both sed and the pep machine have a 'workspace' buffer (which in sed is 
    called the "pattern space"). This workspace is the area where
    manipulations of the text input stream are carried out.

  * The script cycle:
    The languages are based on an implicit cycle. That is to say
    that each command in a sed or a pep script is executed once
    for each line (sed) or once for each character (pep/nom)

  * Syntax:
    The syntax of sed and pep are similar. Statement blocks are
    surrounded by curly braces {} and statements are terminated with
    a semi-colon ; .Also the sed idea of "tests" based on the contents
    of the "pattern space" (or @workspace ) is used in the pep
    language. 

  * Text streams:
    Both sed and pep are text stream based utilities, like many 
    other unix tools. This means that both sed and pep consume an
    input text stream and produce as output an output text stream.
    These streams are directed to the programs using "pipes" | in a 
    console window on both unix and windows systems. For example, for
    sed we could write in a console window
     >> echo abcabcabc | sed "s/b/B/g"
    and the output would be
     >> aBcaBcaBc

    However the pep implementation in c cannot receive input from stdin.  This
    is because *stdin* is used for receiving interactive commands in debug mode.
    Nevertheless, once a script has been translated to another language (eg:
    python, ruby, java, go, tcl) using the translation scripts in the tr/
    folder, then the translated script can be used in a pipe.
    
    For example, we can translate a simple script into ruby and then
    run it as a "filter" program in a pipe
    ----
      pep -f tr/translate.ruby.pss -i "r;t;t;d;" > test.rb
      chmod o+x test.rb; echo "abcd" | ./test.rb
    ,,,

    In the case of "pep", the command line could be written
     >> pep -e "r;'b'{d;add'B'} print;d;" -i "abcabcabc"

    and the output, once again will be
    >> aBcaBcaBc

DIFFERENCES ....

    * Lines vs characters:
     Sed (like AWK) is a "line" based text manipulation tool (text is processed
     one line at a time), whereas pep is character based (text is normally
     processed one character at a time). This means that all the instructions
     in a sed script are executed once for each line of the input text stream,
     but in the case of pep, the instructions are executed once for each
     character of the input text stream.

    * Strict syntax:

     The syntax of the pep language is stricter than that of sed. For example,
     in a pep script all commands must end with a semi-colon (except .reparse,
     parse> and .restart - which affect program flow) and all statements after
     a test must be enclosed in curly braces.  In many versions of sed, it is
     not always necessary to terminate commands with a semi-colon. For example,
     both of the following are valid sed statements.
      >> s/b/B/g s/b/B/g;

    * White space and formatting in scripts:
      Pep is more flexible with the placement of white-space in 
      scripts. For example, in pep one can write
      ------
        "text" 
        { 
          print; }
      ,,,,

      That is, the opening brace is on a different line to the 
      test. This would not be a legal syntax in most versions of sed.
    
    * Command names:

      Sed uses single character "mnemonics" for its commands. For example, "p"
      is print, "s" is substitute, "d" is delete.  In the pep language, in
      contrast, commands also have a long name, such as "print" (which prints
      the workspace), "clear" (to clear or delete the workspace), or "pop" (to
      pop the last element off the stack onto the beginning of the workspace).
      While the sed approach is useful for writing very short, terse scripts,
      the readability of the scripts is not good. Pep allows for improved
      readability, as well as terseness if required. 
     
    * The virtual machines:
      While both sed and pep are based on simple "virtual machines" (which
      consist of string registers and commands to manipulate those registers),
      the pep machine is more extensive. The sed machine essentially has 2
      buffers, the "pattern space", and the "hold space". The pep virtual
      machine however, has a workspace buffer, a stack, a tape array, several
      counting registers and others.
      
    * Regular expressions:
      The tests or "ranges" in sed, as well as the substitutions are based
      on regular expressions. In pep, however, no regular expressions are
      used. The reason for this difference is that pep is designed to
      parse and transform a different set of patterns than sed. The patterns
      that pep is designed to deal with are referred to formally as
      "context free languages" 
      
    * Negation of tests:
      The negation operator ! in the "pep" language is placed
      before the test to which is applies, where as in sed the 
      negation operator comes after the test or range. So, 
      in pep it is correct to write
       >> !"tree" { ... }
      But in sed the correct syntax is
       >> /tree/! { ... }
    
    * implicit read and print
      Sed implicitly reads one line of the input stream for each cycle of the
      script. Pep does not do this, so most scripts need an explicit "read"
      command at the beginning of the script. For example

      * a sed script with an implicit line read
      >> s/a/A/g;
      
      * pep has no implicit character read or print
      >> r; replace "a" "A"; print; clear;

BACKUS-NAUR FORM AND THE PATTERN PARSER

  Backus-naur form is a way of expressing grammar rules for formal languages.
  A variation of BNF is "EBNF" which modifies slightly the syntax of bnf.
  There are many versions of bnf and ebnf

  There is close relationship between the syntax of the 'pep' language
  and a bnf grammar. For example:

  >>  "word*colon*" { clear; add "command*"; push }

  corresponds to the backus-naur form grammar rule

  >> command := word colon

PEP LANGUAGE PARSING ITSELF

  One interesting challenge for the pep language is to "generate itself"
  from a set of bnf rules. In other words given rules such as
  -----
    command := word semicolon;
    command := word quotedtext semicolon;
  ,,,,

  Then it should be possible to write a script in the language 
  which generates the output as follows

  ----
   pop;pop;
   "word*semicolon*" {
     clear; add "command*"; push; .reparse
   }
   pop;
   "word*quotedtext*semicolon*" {
     clear;  add "command*"; push; .reparse
   }
   push;push;push;
  ,,,,

  When I first thought of a virtual machine for parsing languages,
  I thought that it would be interesting and important to build 
  a more expressive language "on-top-of" the pep commands. However,
  that now seems less important.

TOKEN ATTRIBUTE TRANSFORMATIONS

 We can write complete translators/compilers with the script language.
 However it may be nice to have a more expressive format like the one shown
 below.

 * a more expressive compiling language built on top of the parse language
 ----
   command := word semicolon {
     $0 = "<em>" $1 "</em"> $2;
   };
 ...
   
 The $n structure will fetch the tape-cell for the corresponding 
 identifier in the bnf rule at the start of the brace block.
 This would be "compiled" to pep syntax as 

  ----
   pop;pop;
   "word*semicolon*" {
     clear; 
     # assembling: $0 = "<em>" $1 "</em"> $2;
     add "<em>"; get; add "</em>"; ++; get; --; put; clear;
     # resolve new token 
     add "command*"; push; .reparse
   }

   push;push;
  ,,,,


SHIFT REDUCTIONS ON THE STACK 

  Imagine we have a "recogniser" pep script as follows:
  -----
    read; 
    '"' { until '"'; clear; add "quote*"; push; }
    ";" { clear; add "semicolon*"; push; }
    [a-z] { 
      while [a-z]; clear; add "word*"; push; 
    } 
    [:space:] { clear; }
  parse>
    unstack; add "\n"; print; clip; stack; 
    pop;pop;
    "command*command*","commandset*command*"
      { clear; add 'commandset*'; push; .reparse }
    "word*semicolon*" 
      { clear; add 'command*'; push; .reparse }      
    pop;
    "word*quote*semicolon*" 
      { clear; add 'command*'; push; .reparse }      
    push; push; push;
    (eof) { 
       pop; pop;
       "command*", "commandset*" {
         clear; add "Correct syntax! \n"; print; quit;
       }
       clear; add "incorrect syntax! \n"; print; quit;
    }
  ,,,,,
  
  This script recognises a simple language which consists of a series of
  "commands" (which are lower case words) terminated in semicolons. The
  commands can have an optional quoted argument. At the end of the script,
  there should only be one token on the stack (either command* or commandset*). 

  This script corresponds reasonable directly to the ebnf rules
  ----
    word := [a-z]+;
    semicolon := ';';
    commandset := command command;
    command := word semicolon;
  ,,,,

  But in the script above there is a problem; that the first rule
  needs to be applied after the second rule.

  The above statements in the pep language execute a reduction according to
  the grammar rule written above.  Examining the state of the machine
  before and after the script statements above ....
  
  ==:: virtual machine
  .. stack, if-statement, open-brace*, statements*, close-brace*
  .. tape, if(a==b), {, a=1; b=2*a; ..., }
  .. workspace,
  ..,

NEGATION OF TESTS 

 A test such as 
 >> "some-text" { #* commands *# }

 can be modified with the logic operator "!" (not) as in
 >> !"some-text" { #* commands *# }

 Note that the negation operator '!' must come before the test which it
 modifies, instead of afterwards as in "sed" .

 Multiple negations are not allowed, because any even number of negations
 is equivalent to the positive test.
 >> !!"a" {...} # incorrect
  
NEGATION EXAMPLES ....

  * print only numbers in the input 
  >> r; ![0-9] { clip; add " "; print; clear; }

  * print only words not beginning with 'a'
  >> r; [ \n] { d; } !B"a".!"" { E" ",E"\n",(eof) { print; d; }}

 If the end of the input stream has not been reached
 then push the contents of the workspace onto the stack
  >> !(eof) { push; } 
 
 If the value of the workspace is exactly equal to the 
 value of the current element of the tape, then exit
 the script immediately

  >> !(==) { quit; } 

COMMENTS IN THE PEP NOM LANGUAGE 

 Both single line, and multi-line comments are available in the
 parser script language as implemented in books/pars/asm.pp and 
 compile.pss

 * single and multi-line examples
 ---- 
  #* check if the workspace 
    is the text "drib" *#
  "drib" {
    clear; # clear the workspace buffer 
  }
 ,,,,

The script "compile.pss" attempts to preserve comments 
in the output "assembler" code to make that code more readable.

GRAMMAR AND SCRIPT CONSTRUCTION

  My knowledge of formal language grammar theory is quite limited. I am more 
  interested in practical techniques. But there is a reasonably close
  correlation between bnf-type grammar rules and pep/nom script construction.
  
  The right-hand-side of a (E)BNF grammar rule is represented by the 
  quoted text before a brace block, and the left-hand-side 
  correlates to the new token pushed onto the stack.
    
   * the rule "<nounphrase> ::= <article> <noun> ;" in a parse script
   >> "article*noun*" { clear; add "nounphrase*"; push; }

TRICKS 

  This section contains tips about how to perform specific tasks
  within the limitations of the parse machine (which does not have 
  regular expressions, nor any kind of arithmetic).

  See the example eg/plzero.pss for an example of reducing high
  token rules before low token rules, in order to resolve 
  precedence issues. 

  * check if accumulator is equal to 4
  ----
    read; a+; put; clear; count; 
    "4" {  clear; add "4th char is '"; get; "'\n"; print; clear; }
    
  ,,,

  * print only if number 3 digits or greater
  -------
    # check if the input matches the regex /[0-9]{3,}/
    r;
    (eof) {
      [0-9] { put; clip; clip; clip; !"" { clear; get; print; } }
    }
  ,,,

  * print the length of each word in input 
  ----

MULTIPLEXING TOKEN SEQUENCES ....

  Sometimes it is useful to have a long list of token sequences
  before a brace block. One way to reduce this list is as follows

     B"aa*","bb*","cc*" {
       E"xx*","yy*","zz*" {

       }
     }
     # equivalent long token sequence list
     "aa*xx*","aa*yy*","aa*zz*","bb*xx*","bb*yy*","bb*zz*"

COMPILATION TECHNIQUES

  One of the enjoyable aspects of this parsing/compiling machine is discovering
  interesting practical "heuristic" techniques for compiling syntactical
  structures, within the limitations of the machine capabilities.

  This section details some of these techniques as I discover them.

LOOKAHEAD ....

  * a technique for lookahead parsing (json)
  ------
    pop; pop; pop; pop;
    # the test below ensures that there are 4 tokens in the workspace
    # the final token will normally be ]* or ,* (this is a json array)
    # but we dont have to worry about it
    B"items*,item*.!"items*item*" {
      replace "items*,item*" "items*";
      push; push; .reparse
    }
  ,,,
  
RULE ORDER ....

  In a script, after the parse> label we can parse rules in the
  order of the number of tokens. Or we can group the rules by
  token. There are some traps, for example: "pop; pop;" doesn't
  guarantee that there are 2 tokens in the workspace.

RECOGNISERS AND CHECKERS ....

  A recogniser is a parser that only determines if a given string is a valid
  "word" in the given language. We can extend a recogniser to be an error
  checker for a given string, so that it determines at what point (character
  or line number) in the string, the error occurs. The error-checker can also
  give a probably reason for the error (such as the missing or excessive
  syntactic element) This is much more practically useful than a recogniser

EMPTY START TOKEN ....

  When the start symbol is an array of another token, it may often
  simplify parsing to create an empty start token in a "begin" block
  EBNF equivalent: text = word*

  * using an empty start token
  -----
    begin { add "text*"; push; }
    read;
    # ignore white-space
    [:space:] { while [:space:]; clear; }
    !"" { whilenot [:space:]; put; clear; add "word*"; push; }
  parse>
    pop; pop;
    "text*word*" { clear; add "text*"; push; .reparse }  
    (eof) { 
      # check for start symbol 'text* here
    }
    push; push; 
  ,,,

  Without the empty "text*" token we would have to write
  >> "text*word*","word*word*" { <commands> }

  This is not such a great disadvantage, but it does lead to 
  inefficient compiled code, because the "word*word*" token 
  sequence only occurs once when running the script (at the 
  beginning of the input stream)

  * compiled code for "text*word*","word*word*" { ... }
  -------
  ,,,,

  Secondly, in other circumstances, there are other advantages
  of the empty start symbol. See the pars/eg/history.pss script 
  for an example.

END OF STREAM TOKEN ....
 
  This is an analogous technique to the "empty start symbol". In
  many cases it may simplify parsing to create a "dummy" end token
  when the end-of-stream is reached. This token should be created
  immediately after the parse> label

  * example of use of "end" token to parse dates in text
  -------
    # tokens: day month year word
    # rules: 
    #    date = day month year
    #    date = day month word 
    #    date = day month end
    read;
    ![:space:] { 
      whilenot [:space:]; put; clear; 
      [0-9] {
        # matches regex: /[0-9][0-9]*/
        clip; clip; !"" {
        }
      add "word*"; push;
    }
   parse>
    (eof) {
    }
  ,,,,

PALINDROMES ....

  See eg/palindrome.pss for a complete pep/nom palindrome example
  that uses token-stack reductions to recognise palindromes.

  Palindromes are an interesting exercise for the machine because
  they may be the simplest "context-free" language.

  The script below is working but also prints single letters
  as palindromes. See the note below for a solution.

  * print only words that are palindromes
  --------
    read; 
    # the code in this block builds 2 buffers. One with 
    # the original word, and the other with the word in reverse
    # Later, the code checks whether the 2 buffers contain the 
    # same text (a palindrome).
    ![:space:] {
      # save the current character
      ++; ++; put; --; --;
      get; put; clear;
      # restore the current character
      ++; ++; get; --; --;
      ++; swap; get; put; clear; --;
    } 

    # check for palindromes when a space or eof found
    [:space:],<eof> { 
      # clear white space
      [:space:] { while [:space:]; clear; }
      # check if the previous word was a palindrome
      get; ++; 
      # if the word is the same as its reverse and not empty
      # then its a palindrome. 
      (==) { 
        # make sure that palindrome has > 2 characters
        clip; clip; 
        !"" { clear; get; add "\n"; print; }
      } 
      # clear the workspace and 1st two cells
      clear; put; --; put;
    }

  See the example below and adapt

  * a simple line tokenisation example

    [\n] { clear; }
    whilenot [\n]; put; clear;

    "line*line*", "lines*line*" {
      clear; get; add "\n"; ++; get; --; put; clear;

    }

WORD BY WORD TOKENISATION ....

  A common task is to treat the input stream as a series of space
  delimited words. 

  * a simple word tokenisation example, print one word per line
  --------
    read; [:space:] { clear; }
    whilenot [:space:]; put; clear;
    add "word*"; push;
  parse>
    pop; pop; 
    "word*word*", "words*word*" {
      clear; get; add "\n"; ++; get; --; put; clear;
      add "words*"; push; .reparse
    }
    push; push;
    (eof) {
       pop; "words*" { clear; get; print; }
    }
  ,,,,

REPETITIONS ....
 
  The parse machine cannot directly encode rules which contain the ebnf
  repetition construct {}.  The trick below only creates a new list token if
  the preceding token is not a list of the same type.

  * a technique for building a list token from repeated items 
  ----
     # ebnf rules:
     #   alist := a {a}
     #   blist := b {b}

     read;
     # terminal symbols
     "a","b" { add "*"; push; }
     !"" { 
       put; clear; 
       add "incorrect character '"; get; add "'";
       add " at position "; chars; add "\n"; 
       add " only a's and b's allowed. \n"; print; quit;
     }
   parse>
     # 1 token (with extra token)
     pop;
     "a*" { 
       pop; !"a*".!"alist*a*" { push; } 
       clear; add "alist*"; push; .reparse
     }
     "b*" { 
       pop; !"b*".!"blist*b*" { push; } 
       clear; add "blist*"; push; .reparse
     }
     push;
     <eof> {
       unstack; put; clear; add "parse stack is: "; get;
       print; quit; 
     }

OFFSIDE OR INDENT PARSING ....

  Some languages use indentation to indicate blocks of code, or 
  compound statements. Python is an important example. These languages
  are parsed using "indent" and "outdent" or "dedent" tokens.
  
  The mark/go commands should allow parsing of indented languages.

   Untested and incomplete...
   the idea is to issue "outdent" or "indent" tokens by
   comparing the current leading space to a previous 
   space token. But the code below is a mess.
   The tricky thing is that we can have multiple "outdent*"
   tokens from one space* token eg

   * a simple python-esque source code example
   ----
     if g==x:
       while g<100:
         g++
     g:=0;
   ,,,,

  * a basic indent parsing procedure
  --------
    # incomplete!!
    read;
    begin { mark "b"; add ""; ++; }
    [\n] { 
      clear; while [ ]; put; mark "here"; go "b";
      # indentation is equal so, do nothing
      (==) { clear; go "here"; .reparse }
      add "  ";
      (==) { clear; add "indent*"; push; go "here"; .reparse }
      clip; clip;  
      clip; clip;  
      (==) { clear; add "outdent*"; push; go "here"; .reparse }
      put; clear; add "lspace*"; push;
      mark "b";
    }   
   parse>
  ,,,,

OPTIONALITY ....

  The parse machine cannot directly encode the idea of an
  optional "[...]" element in a BNF grammar, nor a "Kleene star"
  element, such as (x)*. But other techniques can be used to 
  recognise and parse these structures.

  * a BNF rule with an optional element
  >> r := 'a' ['b'] .

  In some cases we can just factor out the optional into alternation "|"
    >> r := 'a' | 'a' 'b' .

  However once we have more than 2 or 3 optional elements in a rule, this
  becomes impractical, for example
    >> r := ['a'] ['b'] ['c'] ['d'] .
  
  In order to factor out the optionality above we would end up with
  a large number of rules which would make the parse script very verbose.
  Another approach is to encode some state into a parse token.

   * a strategy for parsing rules containing optional elements
   ----------
     # parse the ebnf rule
     # rule := ['a'] ['b'] ['c'] ['d'] ';' .
     begin { add "0.rule*"; push; }
     read;
     [:space:] { clear; }
     "a","b","c","d",";" { add "*"; push; .reparse  }
     !"" { add " unrecognised character."; print; quit; }
   parse>
     pop; pop;
     E"rule*a*" { 
       B"0" { clear; add "1.rule*"; push; .reparse }
       clear; add "misplaced 'a' \n"; print; quit; 
     } 
     E"rule*b*" { 
       B"0",B"1" { clear; add "2.rule*"; push; .reparse }
       clear; add "misplaced 'b' \n"; print; quit; 
     } 
     E"rule*c*" { 
       B"0",B"1",B"2" { clear; add "3.rule*"; push; .reparse }
       clear; add "misplaced 'c' \n"; print; quit; 
     }
     E"rule*d*" { 
       B"0",B"1",B"2",B"3" { clear; add "4.rule*"; push; .reparse }
       clear; add "misplaced 'd' \n"; print; quit; 
     }

     E"rule*;*" { clear; add "rule*"; push; }

    push; push;
    (eof) {
      pop; 
      "rule*" { add " its a rule!"; print; quit; }
    } 
   ,,,,

REPETITION PARSING ....

  Similar to the notes above about parsing grammar rules containing
  optional elements, we have a difficulty when parsing elements or 
  tokens which are enclosed in a "repetition" structure. In ebnf 
  syntax this is usually represented with either braces "{...}" or 
  with a kleene star "*". 

  We can use a similar technique to the one above to parse repeated
  elements within a rule.

  The rule parsed below is equivalent to the regular expression
    >> /a?b*c*d?;/
  So the script below acts as a recogniser for the above regular
  expression. (I wonder if it would be possible to write a script
  that turns simple regular expressions into pep scripts?)

  In the code below we don't have any separate "blist" or "clist" tokens.
  The code below appears very verbose for a simple task.

   * parsing repetitions within a grammar rule
   ----------
     # parse the EBNF rule
     # rule := ['a'] {'b'} {'c'} ['d'] ';' .
     # equivalent regular expression: /a?b*c*d?;/

     begin { add "0/rule*"; push; }
     read;
     [:space:] { clear; }
     "a","b","c","d",";" { add "*"; push; .reparse  }
     !"" { add " unrecognised character."; print; quit; }
   parse>
   # ------------
   # 2 tokens 
     pop; pop; 

     E"rule*a*" { 
       B"0" { clear; add "a/rule*"; push; .reparse }
       clear; add "misplaced 'a' \n"; print; quit; 
     } 
     E"rule*b*" { 
       B"0",B"a",B"b" { clear; add "b/rule*"; push; .reparse }
       unstack; add " << parse stack.\n"; 
       add "misplaced 'b' \n"; print; quit;
     } 
     E"rule*c*" { 
       B"0",B"a",B"b",B"c" { clear; add "c/rule*"; push; .reparse }
       clear; add "misplaced 'c' \n"; 
       unstack; add " << parse stack.\n"; print; quit;
     }
     E"rule*d*" { 
       B"0",B"a",B"b",B"c" { clear; add "d/rule*"; push; .reparse }
       clear; add "misplaced 'd' \n"; print; quit; 
     }

     E"rule*;*" { clear; add "rule*"; push; }

    push; push;
    (eof) {
      pop; 
      "rule*" { 
        clear; add "text is in regular language /a?b*c*d?;/ \n"; print; quit; 
      }
      push; 
      add "text is not in regular language /a?b*c*d?;/ \n"; 
      add "parse stack was:"; print; clear; 
      unstack; print; quit;
    } 
   ,,,,

PL ZERO ....

  Pl/0 is a minimalistic language created by Niklaus Wirth, for 
  teaching compiler construction.

LOOKAHEAD AND REVERSE REDUCTIONS ....

  The so called "quotesets" have been replaced in the current (aug 2019)
  implementation of compile.pss with 'ortestset' and 'andtestset'. But the
  compilation techniques are similar to those shown below.

  The old implementation of the "quotesets" token in old versions of
  compile.pss seems quite interesting. It waits until the stack contains a
  brace token "{*" until it starts reducing the quoteset list.

   * a "quoteset", or a set of tests with OR logic
   >> 'a','b','c','d' { nop; }

  So the compile.pss script actually parses "'c','d' { " first, and
  then resolves the other quotes ('a','b'). This is good because 
  the script can work out the jump-target for the forward true jump.
  (the accumulator is used to keep track of the forward true jump).

  It also uses the brace as a lookahead, and then just pushes it
  back on the stack, to be used later when parsing the whole brace block.

  * BNF rules for parsing quotesets
  >> quoteset '{' := quote ',' quote '{' ;
  >> quoteset '{' := quote ',' quoteset '{' ;

  But this has 2 elements on the left-hand side. This works but is 
  not considered good grammar (?)

  Multiple "testset" sequences may be used as a poor-persons
  regular expression pattern matcher.

  * print words beginning with 'z', ending with '.txt' and
  * not containing the letter 'o'
  -------
    r;
    E" ",E"\n",(eof) {
      !(eof) { clip; } 
      B"z".E".txt".![o] { add " (yes!) \n"; print; }
      clear;
    }
  ,,,,

  It doesnt really make sense to combine a text-equals test with
  any other test, but the other combinations are useful.

  The "set" token syntax parses a string such as 
  >> 'a','b','c','d' { nop; }

 The comma is the equivalent of the alternation operator (|) in
 BNF syntax.

ASSEMBLY FORMAT AND FILES

  The implementation of the pep script language uses an intermediary "assembly"
  phase when loading scripts. asm.pp is responsible for converting 
  the script into an assembly (text) format. "asm.pp" is itself an
  "assembly-format" file. I refer to this format as "assembly" or "assembler"
  because it is similar to other assembly languages: It has one instruction
  per line. These files consist of "instructions" on the virtual
  machine, along with "parameters", jumps, tests and jump labels, (which make
  writing assembly files much easier since line numbers do not have 
  to be used). So the asm.pp file actually implements the pep script language.

  It is not necessary for the pep/nom script writer to know anything about
  the assembly format or process. However, for scripts which contain
  hard-to-find bugs it is useful to load a script into the pep interpreter
  in "interactive" mode and step through the script. This interactive mode
  displays the compiled script in assembly format.

  * load the script 'eg/palindromes.pss' in interactive mode
  >> pep -If eg/palindrome.pss -i 'hannah'

  "The proof is in the pudding": The implementation of the pep script language
  shows that the pep system (and the pep virtual-machine) is capable of
  implementing code languages and data languages (or at least simple ones).

  The assembler file syntax is similar to other machine assemblers:
  1 command per line, leading space is insignificant. Labels are 
  permitted and end in a ":" character. 

  * convert the script 'brackets.pss' to its compiled form
  >> pep -f compile.pss brackets.pss

  * an example compilation of a simple script 
  ------- 
  # pep script source
  # read; "abc" { nop; }
  # pep/nom 'assembly' equivalent of the above script 
    start:
    read
    testis "abc"
    jumpfalse block.end.21
      nop
    block.end.21:
    jump start 
  ,,,

  * another example showing begin-block compilation 
  ---------
  # pep script source
  # begin { whilenot [:space:]; clear; } read; [:space:] { d; }
  # compilation:

    whilenot [:space:]
    clear
    start:
    read
    testclass [:space:]
    jumpfalse block.end.60
      clear
    block.end.60:
    jump start 
  ,,,,

COMPARISON WITH OTHER COMPILER COMPILERS

  As far as I am aware, all other compiler compiler systems take 
  some kind of a grammar as input, and produce source code as 
  output. The produced source code acts as a "recogniser" for 
  strings which conform to the given grammar.

YACC AND LEX COMPARISON ....

  The tools "yacc" and "lex" and the very numerous clones, rewrites
  and implementations of those tools are very popular in the implementation
  of parsers and compilers. This section discusses some of the 
  important differences between the pep machine and language and 
  those tools.

  The pep language and machine is (deliberately) a much more limited system
  than a "lex/yacc" style combination. A lex/yacc-type system often produces "c"
  language code or some other language code which is then compiled and run to
  implement the parser/compiler. 

  The pep system, on the other hand, is a "text stream filter"; it simply 
  transforms one text format into another. For this reason, it cannot
  perform the complex programmatic "actions" that tools such as lex/yacc
  bison or ANTLR can achieve.

  While clearly more limited than a lex-yacc style system, in my opinion
  the current machine has some advantages:

   u/- It may be simpler and therefore should be easier to understand
    - It does not make use of shift-reduce tables.
    - It should be possible to implement it on computer environments with
      modest resources (data/code memory).
    - Because it is a text-filter, it should be more accessible for "playing
      around" or experimentation. Perhaps it lacks the psychological barrier
      that a lex-yacc system has for a non-specialist programmer.
    - Using translation "pep" scripts (in the tr/ folder), we can translate any
      pep/nom script into a number of other languages, such as python, ruby,
      java, go and plain c. These translation scripts (eg
      tr/translate.python.pss) can also translate themselves, thus creating a
      complete stand-alone pep system in the target language.
    - It is relatively easy to create a pep translation script for a new
      language: a class/object/data-structure is created representing the pep
      virtual machine, and then an existing translation script is adapted for
      the new language.

STATUS 

  As of June 2022, the interpreter and debugger written in c (i.e
  /books/pars/object/pep.c ) works well. This implementation is 
  not Unicode-aware and has a "tape" array of fixed size, but these 
  problems are somewhat obviated by the existence of the translation
  scripts in the tr/ folder.

  A number of interesting and/or useful examples have been written using the
  "pep" script language and are in the "eg/" folder 

  Several translation scripts have been written and are largely bug-free
  such as for the languages java, go, ruby, python, tcl, and c. These 
  scripts can be tested with the "pep.tt" helper function in the
  helpers.pars.sh bash script. I would like to finish the translation
  scripts for swift, c++, javascript and rust.

NAMING OF THE "PEP NOM" SYSTEM

  The system has 2 names "pep" and "nom" or "pep/nom".
  The executable is called 'pep' standing for "Parse Engine for Patterns"
  The source code and examples and translation scripts are contained in
  a folder called pars/

  The main c source file for the interpreter is called object/pep.c and uses
  structures and code in the same "object" directory.  Pep scripts are given a
  ".pss" file extension, and files in the "assembler format have a ".pp" file
  extension.

  The source files are split into .c files where each one corresponds to a
  particular "object" (data structure) within the machine (e.g. tape-cell, tape,
  buffer with stack and workspace). 

  'pep' is is not an "evocative" name (unlike, for example, "lisp"),
  but it fits with standard short Unix tool naming.

  Another name for the system is be "nom" which is a slight reference to "noam"
  (as in Chomsky) and also an Indo-European (?) root for "name"

LIMITATIONS AND BUGS

  
 u/- The main interpreter 'pep' (source /books/pars/object/pep.c) is 
     written using plain c byte characters. This seemed a big limitation, but
     the scripts translate.xxx.pss are a simple way to accommodate Unicode
     characters without rewriting the code in pep.c
   - The tape structure in the c interpreter is of a fixed size (instead
     of being dynamically allocated) and so the interpreter will crash
     if a very large number of tokens are on the stack. 
   - the pep/nom tool cannot receive the input-stream from STDIN. This is 
     very "un-Unix-like" but is unavoidable because the "pep" executable
     allows interactive debugging. However, once a script is translated 
     into another language (such as python/ruby/c/go/java/javascript)
     it can function as a normal unix "filter" program.
   - some segmentation faults may remain in pep.c 

IDEAS


  u/- 
    a simple language which can generate xcode-compatible swift and 
    android java for writing apps. A json-like layout language to 
    replace android xml layouts.
  - parsing regular expressions shouldn't be that difficult:
      >> [0-9abcd]n*a+
  - A vim command to compile and run a fragment with translate.java.pss
  - A script to turn a Bash shell history file with comments into a python or perl
    array of objects (so that we can easily eliminate duplicated commands). And
    eliminate simple commands immediately with pep. (Partly done in the 
    script eg/bash.history.pss
  - An indent parser with tokens: space newline word words leading.space =
    nl space ....


FUTURE CHANGES TO THE "PEPNOM" LANGUAGE AND MACHINE

  In the future, scripts may be able to define new character classes
  in the following way.

  * define new named character classes
  ----
    begin { 
      class "brackets" [{}()]; 
      class "idchar" [a-z],[.$]; 
    } 
    # now use the new character class
    [:brackets:] {
      while [:brackets:]; clear;
    } print;
  ,,,

  The commands and new syntax below have not been implemented
  but might solve a range of problems.

  Here are some possible future changes to the machine.

  o/- abbreviations for character classes eg [:S:] for [:space:]
      (already in translate.java.pss and some other "transpilers"
      but not "pep.c" )
    - a "length" command that sets the accumulator to the length
      of the current workspace?? 
    - some accumulator based tests might be good. eg:
      :: >n { <commands> } # check if accumulator greater than n
      :: <n { <commands> } # check if accumulator less than n
      :: setchars # set accumulator = character counter
      :: setlines # set accumulator = line counter
    - create a "forth"/c++ language version of the machine
    - I may separate the error checking code which is currently
      in compile.pss into a separate script error.pss . This will 
      allow the same code to be used in other scripts such as
      translate.java.pss
    - add a new command "untiltape" or just "until" which has no arguments,
      which reads the input stream until the workspace ends with
      the text contained in the current cell of the tape.
      One application of this command would be parsing gnu sed
      syntax, where the pattern delimiter is what ever character 
      follows the "s" for example:
         >> s/a*b/c/
         >> s@a*b@c@
         >> s#a*b#c#
    - a new command "replacetape" which replaces text in the workspace
      with the contents of the current tape cell. eg:
        replace all newlines in the workspace with current cell contents
        >> replacetape "\n"; 
    - remove "bail" the command. Instead allow the "quit" command to 
      return an exit code.

HISTORY OF IDEA

  The file object/pep.c contains detailed information about the 
  development of this idea. The file pars/index.txt contains a history
  of recent work carried out on the system. Each script file (including
  translation scripts and examples) contains a history of work on that 
  particular script.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY FOR THE MACHINE

  When designing the pep/nom virtual-machine, I wanted to make its capabilities
  as limited as possible, while still being able to properly parse and
  translate "most" context-free languages and some context-sensitive languages.
  Related to this idea, was the aim to make the virtual-machine implementable
  in the smallest possible way.

  Also, I deliberately excluded the use of regular expressions, so
  that the script writer would not be tempted to try to "parse" 
  context-free patterns with them.

  The general design of the syntax and command-line usage is inspired
  by some old Unix tools, such as sed, grep and awk

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS OR LACK THEREOF ....

  As oft-repeated in this document, the "pep/nom" virtual-machine for parsing
  and the pep/nom language does not support regular expressions. This may seem
  a strange decision, considering that all existing "lexers" (tools that
  perform the "lexing" phase of compilation) support regular expressions 
  (as far as I know). 

  I omitted regular expressions from the virtual machine so that the machine
  could be implemented in a minimal size and also, so that it
  would run quickly. I am still hopeful that it is possible to 
  implement the machine on embedded architectures (eg the Atmega328), which
  have very limited resources. 
  
  An interesting example is as follows: A pep script is used to create a
  compiler for a simple language for embedded systems. A translator script
  is then used to translate this compiler into embedded c and compiled.
  The user of the embedded system can then enter commands in the language
  which are immediately compiled and run on the embedded system.
  This would create a system similar to micro-python or forth with more 
  flexibility.
  
EVOLUTION OF THE VIRTUAL MACHINE AND LANGUAGE

  * The "a+" and "a-" commands were initially called "plus" and "minus"
  * The "lines" and "chars" (line number and character number) registers
    and commands are important additions, because they
    allow script error messages to pinpoint the line and character number 
    of the error (which is a service that almost all compilers and interpreters
    provide). 
  * The "mark" and "go" commands are later additions, and were at 
    first added to try to allow "indent" parsing, (also called "offside"
    parsing, such as is used in the Python language)

IMPORTANT FILES AND FOLDERS

  This section describes some of the key files and folders within
  the parse-machine implementation at 
  http://bumble.sourceforge.net/books/pars/

EXAMPLE SCRIPTS ....

   The folder eg/ contains a set of scripts to demonstrate
   the utility of the pep/nom language and machine. Here is a 
   description of some of these scripts.

 u/- sed.tojava.pss
      converts a gnu "sed" script into java. All syntax is supported except
      branching and alternative substitution delimiters (eg "s#a#A#g")
   - mark.latex.pss
      Converts a plain text format into LaTeX (and hence pdf via pdflatex).
   - palindrome.pss
      Finds almost all palindromes (and sub-palindromes) in the 
      input.
   - exp.tolisp.pss
      formats simple arithmetic expressions, of the form 
      "a+b*c+(d/e)" into a lisp-style syntax.
   - brainf.toclang.pss
      compiles the simple brainf*** language to plain c.
   - bash.history.pss
      parses a bash history file which may contain comments for 
      a particular command as well as the time-stamp and removes
      trivial commands.
   - json.check.pss
      parses and checks text data in the JSON format .
   - plzero.parse.pss
      parses and checks N. Wirth's PL/0 teaching language
   - ro.xxx.pss
      various scripts which solve problems proposed on the 
      rosettacode.org site.

COMPILE DOT PSS ....

  This is the script compiler and also the compiler compiler.  It has replaced
  the handcoded /books/pars/asm.pp file because it is easier to write and
  maintain.

ASM DOT PP ....

  This file implements the "pep" scripting language. It is a text file which
  consists of a series of "instructions" or commands for the pep virtual
  machine. These instructions include instructions which alter the registers of
  the virtual machine; tests, which set the flag register of the machine to
  true if the test returns true, or else false; and conditional and
  unconditional jumps which change the instruction pointer for the machine if
  the flag register is true.
  
  'Asm.pp' also contains labels (lines ending in ":"). These labels make
  it much easier to write code containing jumps (a label can be used 
  instead of an instruction number. 

  Because of the similarity of this format to many "assembly" languages
  I refer to this as assembly language for the pep virtual machine.

  "asm.pp" is generated from pars/compile.pss with
    >> pep -f compile.pss compile.pss > asm.new.pp; cp asm.new.pp asm.pp;
  (and then delete the final print statement at the end of asm.pp)

  This is a good example of the utility of scripts being run on themselves.
  In fact, all the "translate.xxx.pss" scripts can be (and are) used in this way.
  For example:
    >> pep -f translate.java.pss translate.java.pss > Machine.java

  This creates a java source file which, when compiled with "javac" 
  is able to compile scripts into java.

VIM AND PEP

  I usually edit with the (annoying but excellent) "vim" text editor. Here are
  some techniques for using Vim with the pep/nom tool.  The vim mappings and
  commands below are useful for checking that pep "one-liners" and pep scripts
  or script fragments contained within a text document, actually compile and
  run. This may be a way of approximating Knuth's "literate programming" idea.

  The multi-line snippets are contained in a plain text document within "---"
  and ",,," tags, which are both on an otherwise empty line.

  * create a vim command to run a script embedded in a text document
  * with input provided as an argument to the vim command
  >> com! -nargs=1 Ppm ?^ *---?+1,/^ *,,,/-1w !sed 's/^//' > test.pss; /Users/baobab/sf/htdocs/books/pars/pep -f test.pss -i "<args>"

  * create a vim command to compile to "assembly" format, an embedded script 
  >> com! Ppcc ?^ *---?+1,/^ *,,,/-1w !sed 's/^//' > test.pss; /Users/baobab/sf/htdocs/books/pars/pep -f compile.pss test.pss 

  (The assembly compilation will be printed to STDOUT )

  * compile a one line script to assembly format and save as test.asm 
  >> com! -nargs=1 Pplcc .w !sed 's/^ *>>//' > test.pss; /Users/baobab/sf/htdocs/books/pars/pep -f compile.pss test.pss > test.asm

  * run a one line script embedded in a text document, input stream as arg
  >> com! -nargs=1 Ppl .w !sed 's/^ *>>//' > test.pss; ./pep -f test.pss -i "<args>"

  Given a one line script such as the following
  >> read; "'" { until "'"; print; } clear;

  Typing ":Ppl one'two'three" within the "Vim" text editor, with the cursor
  positioned on the same line (the line beginning with ">>"), will execute the
  script with the text as input.

 There will be quoting problems if the input contains " characters.

  * run a multi-line script embedded in a text document
  * with the input given as an argument 
  >> com! -nargs=1 Ppm ?^ *---?+1,/^ *,,,/-1w !sed 's/^//' > test.pss; ~/sf/htdocs/books/pars/pep -f test.pss -i "<args>" 

  * run a multi-line script embedded in a text document
  * with the file pars-book.txt as the input stream
  >> com! Ppf ?^ *---?+1,/^ *,,,/-1w !sed 's/^//' > test.pss; ~/sf/htdocs/books/pars/pep -f test.pss pars-book.txt

  * run a one line script embedded in a text document
  * with the file "pars-book.txt" as the input stream. 
  >> com! Ppll .w !sed 's/^ *>>//' > test.pss; ~/sf/htdocs/books/pars/pep -f test.pss pars-book.txt 

  The mapping below can only run the script with a static input "abc"
  which is not very useful, but at least it tests if the script compiles
  properly. The compiled script will be saved in "sav.pp"

  * create a vim mapping to run a script embedded in a text document
  >> map ,pp :?^ *---?+1,/^ *,,,/-1w! test.pss \| !pp -f test.pss -i "abc"<cr>

  * create a vim mapping to execute the current line as a bash "one-liner"
  >> map ,pl :.w !sed 's/^ *>>//' \| bash

  * create a vim command to execute the current line as a pep "one-liner"
  >> command! Ppl .w !sed 's/^ *>>//' | bash

  The mappings and commands are for putting in the .vimrc file. To 
  create them within the editor prepend a ":" to each mapping etc.
  >> :command! Ppl .w !sed 's/^ *>>//' | bash

CONVERT AND RUN WITH JAVA ....

  The vim commands below work because 'translate.java.pss' and 'pep' and 
  pars-book.txt (this document) are all in the same folder. The paths
  below would have to be ajusted if that were not the case.

  The commands below are very useful for testing the soundness of the 
  'translate.java.pss' script.

  * convert to java and run a multiline script embedded in a text document
  * with the input given as an argument 
  >> com! -nargs=1 Ppmj ?^ *---?+1,/^ *,,,/-1w !sed 's/^//' > test.pss; echo "[translating to java and compiling]"; ./pep -f translate.java.pss test.pss > Machine.java; javac Machine.java; echo "[running code]"; echo "<args>" | java Machine

  * convert to java a script embedded in a text document, input stream as arg
  >> com! -nargs=1 Pplj .w !sed 's/^ *>>//' > test.pss; echo "[translating to java and compiling]"; ./pep -f translate.java.pss test.pss > Machine.java; javac Machine.java; echo "[running code]"; echo "<args>" | java Machine


HISTORY

  See /books/pars/object/pep.c for detailed development history of the 
  script interpreter (written in c).

  22 june 2022
    Continued work on translator scripts (perl, js) and on examples
  13 march 2020
    made "chars" and "lines" aliases for cc and ll in compile.pss
  2 November 2019
    Need to write tr/translate.c.pss to create executable code. This 
    is based on translate.java.pss . Also would like to write 
    translate.php.pss so that scripts can easily be run on a web-server.
    Also, translate.python.pss since python is an important modern
    language (done). translate.swift.pss translate.ruby.pss (done)
    translate.forth.pss 

    Need to fix mark.html.pss to produce acceptable html output from
    this booklet file. Also need to write mark.latex.pss , based 
    on mark.html.pss so that I can create a decent pdf booklet. Then
    need to print the booklet with some images and send to people
    who may be interested in this.

  27 sept 2019
    translate.js.pss is nearing completion... seems to be able
    to compile many scripts to javascript.

  25 august 2019
    Great progress has been made. compile.pss has all sorts of 
    nice new syntax like negated text= tests !"abc"{ ... }
    Almost all tests can now be negated. There is now an "AND" concatenation
    operator (.).

    begin blocks, begintests in ortestsets. compile.pss
    has replaced asm.handcode.pp for compiling scripts.

2019

  For a number of years I have been working on a project to write a virtual
  machine for pattern parsing. The code is located at
  https://bumble.sf.net/books/pars/ is) used to implement a script language for
  parsing and compiling some context-free languages. (The implementation is in
  'asm.pp')

  The project is now at a stage where useful scripts can be written in
  the parse-script language.

  The purpose of the virtual machine is to be able to parse and transform
  patterns which cannot normally be dealt with through "regular expressions".
  I.e patterns which are not "regular languages". Possibly the simplest
  example of one of these would be palindromes (eg: "aba", "hannah", "anna").
  The machine also allows a script language to describe patterns and
  transformations, and this language has similarities to sed and to awk. 

  In fact the whole idea was inspired by sed and its limitations for 
  context free languages.

  Palindromes are interesting because they can be parsed with the 
  simplest possible recursive-descent parser. 
   
  The "pep" machine does not use recursive-descent parsing. In fact,
  the pep machine was written to avoid recursive-descent parsing.
