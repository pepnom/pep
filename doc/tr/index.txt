   Any nom translation script can translate itself to create

## THE NOM TRANSLATION DOCUMENTATION FOLDER


 This folder documents each of the nom translation scripts that 
 are in the /tr/ folder. It also contains other documents about 
 the translation process such as /doc/tr/nom.second.generation.doc.html  

 I feel that the ease of translation of nom into other languages, and 
 the idea that all nom translators can actually translate themselves 
 and other translators is an important and unique part of the 
 pep/nom system.
