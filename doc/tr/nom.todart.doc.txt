## THE NOM TO DART TRANSLATION SCRIPT

  The nom -> dart translation script is called /tr/nom.todart.pss
  and is one of the more recent translation scripts that I have 
  written (april 2025). It uses a new and better grammar and error
  checking compared to the older translation scripts which are called
  *translate.<lang>.pss* It also handles unicode character categories
  and unicode script names.

  First create a pubspec file so that the dart program will compile.
  This is required also because the 'characters' package is needed 
  to handly unicode grapheme clusters (the standard string methods in 
  dart are cluster-agnostic)

  * an example pubspec file for a translated dart program
  ----
    name: nom.todart
    environment:
      sdk: '>=2.18.0 <3.0.0'
    dependencies:
      characters: ^1.3.0
  ,,,,

  The run "dart pub get". 

  * translate a nom script file into dart and run with input
  -----
    pep -f eg/nom.todart.pss script.pss > script.dart 
    dart compile exe script.dart
    echo 'some input' | ./script.exe
  ,,,,,

### NOTES

  The script file also contains a header with documentation about 
  the script.

### BUGS AND ISSUES

  april 2025: 
    I haven't finished the string parsing code for saving the 
    parse output in a string

    I haven't done *second generation* testing on the script
    (that is: translating the translator with itself and then
    using the compiled translator).
