## THE NOM TO JAVA TRANSLATOR

  The nom -> java translator is called /tr/translate.java.pss
  As is indicated by its name it is an older translation script and 
  needs to be ported to the new code pattern. However it works 
  well according to my (somewhat limited) testing and also appears 
  to work with 2nd generation tests.

  The bash function below which is in nomsf://helpers.pars.sh tests 
  the java translator with a set of one line scripts which are in
  /tr/translate.test.txt Every command in the nom language is tested.
  But multiline scripts and unicode mulibyte characters and grapheme
  clusters are not tested.

### BUGS AND ISSUES

  - The translator uses the old grammar which is not great
  - I don't think a parse> label can go at the start or end 
    of a script
  - This uses a java 'int' to hold unicode code points which hopefully
    works ok (I think that better that using a Character) but it 
    doesn't handly unicode grapheme clusters (combining marks, underlines
    diacritics and so forth) which is usually what you would want.
