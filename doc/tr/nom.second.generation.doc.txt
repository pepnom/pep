## SECOND GENERATION TRANSLATION IN NOM

 It is a strange-ish fact that any nom script that translates
 nom scripts into another format or language can be run *on itself*.

 What is more, this has a practical purpose: to create a pep/nom engine in the
 target language. This facility is similar to the idea of a compiler being
 'self-hosted' but it works for *every* nom translation script in the /tr/
 folder (at least the ones that have been properly debugged - feel free to lend
 a hand). Nom also has a self-hosting compiler called nomsf://compile.pss which
 is (obviously) a nom script.

 I cannot think of any domain specific language which is capable of 
 doing this. 

 * translate the ruby translator into ruby
 >> pep -f tr/translate.ruby.pss tr/translate.ruby.pss > machine.rb

 * use the ruby pep/nom engine to translate nom
 >> echo 'r;t;t;d;' | ruby machine.rb > test.rb

 The line above produces a ruby script called test.rb which does the 
 same thing that the nom script 'r;t;t;d;' does (print every character
 in the input stream twice). 

 There are even more bizarre and amazing implications of the idea of 
 a "translator translating the translator in order to create a 
 translator". For example, the generational translation can be repeated
 as many times as desired and into any language for which a translator
 exists.

 Even more bizarre is the fact that in languages like perl which are 
 capable of executing a string as code, then we can use the translated
 translator as an *interpreter* (after adding a small addition method
 which executed the compiled script as a string and adding a 
 command line switch to read the input script file.)

 The perl translator is currently not finished (2025) so I can't completely
 demonstrate this but I have achieved it successfully with simple scripts.

 The bash function *pep.tt* which is in the helper file nomsf://helpers.pars.sh
 actually tests each translator with second generation scripts. That is 
 to say that it translates the translator and then checks that new translator
 compiles an executes all the one-line scripts correctly.

 This is a big topic and I will come back to this document to expand
 and explain the ramifications of all this, with specific examples for 
 different translation scripts.

 To be continued.
