### The Pep/Nom documents folder

 This folder contains documentation about the *Nom* interpreted and compilable
 language and the *Pep* Pattern Engine for parsing.

 *Nom* is a language with a syntax similar to "sed"
 https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html but hopefully less cryptic
 than *sed* . Whereas *sed* matches and replaces "regular expression"
 wp://regular.expression patterns, *nom* recognises and transforms, translates
 or compiles context-free patterns or languages.

 The folder file:///doc/commands/ contains information about 
 each command in the nom language such as the nom://add command, the 
 nom://push command and so on. The "command index" 
 file:///doc/commands/doc.dir.index.html contains a list of commands 
 and links to their documentation

 The folder file:///doc/syntax/ contains information about 
 the syntax of the *nom* language, as it is defined in the nom 
 compiler nomsf://compile.pss . The page file:///doc/syntax/doc.dir.index.html
 has a list of files in the syntax documentation.

 The folder file:///doc/machine/ contains documentation about 
 the *pep* "virtual machine" pep://machine and each of its parts such as
 the pep://stack , the pep://tape and the pep://workspace buffer among 
 others

 There is a booklet about the Pep&Nom system in plain text 
 file://pepnom-book.txt and html nomsf://pars-book.html but the documents
 here are more up-to-date.
