## WORD BY WORD PARSING WITH NOM

 parsing word-by-word with the [nom] language

 *nom* includes several commands for "lexing" wp://lexical.analysis (or
 "scanning" ) the input-stream. These include the most fundamental which is
 nom://read and also nom://until , nom://while and nom://whilenot . The last 3
 words are designed to create parse-tokens from chunks of text (or chunks of
 the input-stream). 
 
 The nom://until command is convenient in cases where the *end* delimiter
 is more than one character. nom://until also has the advantage that 
 it automatically ignores an end delimiter if that delimiter is 
 "escaped" with the escape character (which is \\ by default).
 
 * parse quoted strings with until
 -----+
  # this will parse strings like "text\"text" and "text"
  read; '"' { 
    until '"'; put; 
    clear; add "string*"; push; .reparse
  }
  # ignore everything else
  !"" { clear; }
  parse>
  pop; 
  "string*" { 
    clear; get; clip; clop; 
    add "\n"; print; clear;
  }
  push;

### PARSING WORDS

 But for parsing words the nom://while and nom://whilenot commands 
 are more useful.

 * highlight repeated words 
 -----+
  read; [:alpha:] { 
    while [:alpha:]; put; 
    clear; add "word*"; push; .reparse
  }
  # ignore everything else
  !"" { clear; }
  parse>
  pop;pop; 
  "word*word*" { 
    clear; get; ++; 
    (==) { 
      clear; add "**"; get; add " "; get; add "**\n";
      print; clear; --; .reparse
    }
    --; clear;
    add "word*word*"; 
  }
  push;push;
 ,,,

### NOTES

 [nom] does not currently allow conjunction sets of characters
 which means that you either have to explicitly name every character 
 that you wish to include in your word* token, or else use one of the
 predefined character "classes" /doc/pepnom.doc.classes.html such 
 as *[:alpha:]* or [:alnum:]. This is a significant limitation
 which is seen in the *nom* [xml] "parser/error-checker" 
 /eg/xml.parse.pss because "names" in *xml* syntax can contain
 '.' '-' or '_' or any [unicode] alphabetic character. But there is 
 no easy way to add these three characters to the [:alpha:] unicode 
 class.
