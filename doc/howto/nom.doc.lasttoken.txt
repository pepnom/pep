## GET THE LAST TOKEN IN A SEQUENCE

  How to get the last token attribute in a variable number of 
  tokens.

  Some times we may match, for example, 3 tokens or less but we need 
  to get the attribute of the last token in the sequence. This document
  explains how to do it.

  In the code below we know that the last token in the sequence is
  called list* but we don't know exactly how many tokens are in the 
  token sequence. It could be 1,2 or 3, with a maximum of 3.
  So we can use the trick below to get the attribute of the list*
  token. The trick basically involves to keep pushing until the 
  workspace is empty and then nom://pop the last token off the 
  stack

  * get the attribute of the last token
  ----------+
    pop;pop;pop;
    E"list*" {
      push; !"" { push; !"" { push; } }
      pop; clear; 
      # now get the list* token attribute
      get;
      # do something with the attribute etc 
      .reparse
    }
    push;push;push;

### NOTES

  Remember that three nom://pop commands don't necessarily mean
  that there are 3 parse tokens in the pep://workspace text buffer.
  In fact, there may be 0,1,2 or 3 tokens depending on how many 
  tokens were on the stack before the pop commands. 

  This can be a source of logic errors in scripts because it is 
  easy to assume that there must be 3 tokens in the workspace.
