## INSIDE OUTSIDE PARSING WITH NOM

 how to parse inside delimiters and outside at the same time.

 Sometimes it is desirable to parse/compile text which is *within* or
 *inside* 2 text delimiters in a certain way, and text which is 
 *outside* the delimiters in another way. An example might be parsing
 a computer language which allows nested multiline comments. Outside 
 of the comments whose delimiters might be "/*" and "*/" we would 
 like to parse the language normally in order to transpile it or compile
 it to [llvm] or some other assembly language.

 But inside the comment delimiters, we can ignore all text except the 
 comment delimiters themselves.

 The script /eg/nom.snippet.tohtml.pss is a good example of inside/outside
 parsing (I just made up that terminology). The technique that I have 
 developed with nom is to use the accumulator as a state variable indicatiing
 if we are inside or outside of the delimiters.

 * a pattern for inside/outside parsing 
 -------+
   count; 
   # outside the delimiters, initially state of the machine
   "0" {
     clear; read; 
     # when you find the end delimiter
     a+; .restart
   }
   # inside the delimiters
   "1" {
     clear; read; 
     # when you find the end delimiter
     zero; .restart
   }
