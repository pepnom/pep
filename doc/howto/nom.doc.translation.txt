## THE NOM TRANSLATION SCRIPTS

  Translating the Nom language into other (computer) languages.

  A set of nom "translation" nomsf://tr/  scripts exist which allow any nom
  script to be translated into other languages. Translation scripts exist for
  "Go" nomsf://tr/translate.go.pss "Java" nomsf://tr/translate.java.pss
  "Javascript" nomsf://tr/translate.js.pss "Ruby" nomsf://tr/translate.ruby.pss
  "Python" nomsf://tr/translate.py.pss and "TCL" nomsf://tr/translate.tcl.pss
  and other translation scripts are being developed for Swift, Perl, Rust,
  Dart and (hopefully one day) Forth. 

  The translation scripts can translate any [nom] script which means that 
  they can translate themselves or another language translation script.

  * The nom-to-ruby translation script translating itself
  >> pep -f tr/translate.ruby.pss tr/translate.ruby.pss > nom.to.ruby.rb

  Notice that what is produced is a ruby script that can translate 
  [nom] scripts to ruby.

### SECOND GENERATION TRANSLATION

  A somewhat strange corollary of this *self-translation* feature is 
  that we can do 2nd Generation translation, as follows

  * showing 2nd generation nom-to-ruby translation with the html formatter
  ----+
    pep -f tr/translate.ruby.pss tr/translate.ruby.pss > nom.to.ruby.rb
    chmod a+x nom.to.ruby.rb
    cat eg/text.tohtml.pss | ./nom.to.ruby.rb > text.tohtml.rb
    chmod a+x text.tohtml.rb
    cat index.txt | ./text.tohtml.rb > index.html
  ,,,

  * now use this ruby "engine" to translate and run any other nom script
  -----+
    # translate the palindrome recogniser script to ruby and run
    cat eg/palindrome.pss | ./nom.to.ruby.rb > palindrome.rb
    chmod a+x palindrome.rb
    echo "refer to hannah and her sisters" | ./palindrome.rb
  ,,,,

  This is so remarkable, that I find it hard to believe that it works,
  but it does. The same thing is possible with all the other translation
  scripts (at least the ones that are not still being debugged).

  The practical purpose of 2nd generation translation is that you can 
  completely dispense with the original "pep" file:///doc/peptool interpreter
  and run all nom scripts through the language compiler of your choice. 
  This has the advantage of adding "Unicode" https://home.unicode.org
  support to your nom scripts (depending on how good it is in the 
  translation language).

  Also, 3rd , 4th , 5th etc generation compilation is possible, but 
  I dont really know what its practical use would be.

### THINGS TO CHANGE

  All of the translation scripts currently just create a standalone script or
  compilable source code (in the case of [go] or [java] ).  It would be better
  for the translated script to be placed in a *parse()* method which could read
  and write to any input and output stream. This allows the nom script
  translation to be used within other programs in that particular language.

  Put the nom syntax error checking code after the nomsyn://parse> label in one
  block so that I can use the same syntax error-checking in every 
  translation script and also in nomsf://compile.pss

  Make a standard syntax error message for all translation scripts.

### NOTES

  I am in the process (feb 2025) of "reforming" some of the translation 
  scripts. For example, the nom-to-perl translation script (which is 
  in development) uses a much better and simpler grammar than some of the 
  older translation scripts. Also, I would like to make the error checking
  and error message better and standard across all the translation scripts,
  and introduce a new parse token "script*" which will indicate a 
  complete valid nom script has been recognised.

  The grammar of the early translation scripts was based upon the nom syntax
  grammar contained in the nom language compiler nomsf://compile.pss . But 
  that script uses a special (and somewhat elaborate) grammar because of 
  the need to compile to a (pseudo) assembly language (the [pep] assembly
  language).

### NOM AND FORTH

  The [forth] translation script is actually the most important because 
  it would allow the whole pep/nom system to run on an extremely small
  but capable virtual machine. Unfortunately the forth translation is also
  the most difficult because all memory management has to be done by 
  the programmer. The [pep] pep://machine contains an array of mutable,
  expandable strings (which I call the pep://tape because it has a pointer
  to the current tape cell) and that may be tricky to implement in Forth.

  If it is possible, we would have a system in which expressive languages 
  could be implemented and run on very small machines such as 
  microcontrollers.
