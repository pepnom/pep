### THE PEPTOOL FOLDER

 This documentation directory is about the interpreter which is 
 called *pep* (It probably shouldn't have the same name as the 
 virtual machine, but I won't worry about that for now).

 The *pep* interpreter is written in "plain" c. That is, not c++
 nor "rust" www.rust-lang.org . Just "good old" c. Actually, if I had
 known about, or known "go" https://go.dev or *rust* or even "dart"
 https://dart.dev then I probably would have used one of those languages.
 But I didn't, so I didn't.

 The pep interpreter has a very handy debugging or *interactive* mode
 which can be activated with the *-I* switch (and it has nice 
 colours as well)

 * watch the virtual machine as a nom script executes
 >> pep -If eg/exp.tolisp.pss -i "(-b + (b^2-4*a*c)^(1/2))/(2*a)"

 This is quite interesting to do, because you can see exactly how 
 the *PEP* virtual machine is operating and you can also see all the 
 nom statement in the *compiled* form (a sort of pseudo assembly).

 The pep interactive or debug mode has many different commands, such
 as *rrw* (run until the pep://workspace is a given text) or 
 *ls* (list the compiled instructions). Type "hh" to see all commands.

 Normally, you will not need the debug mode to actually debug scripts 
 because there are easier ways: for example you can display the parse
 tokens as in the following example.

 * display the parse stack tokens during script execution.
 ----
 parse>
   add "<!-- line "; lines; add " char "; chars; add ": "; print; clear; 
   unstack; print; stack; add " -->\n"; print; clear;
 ,,,,

 But the *-I* switch was very handy during the implementation of the 
 pep interpreter to make sure that the virtual machine was working
 as expected. And it is one reason I have no desire to reimplement the 
 interpreter in a different language.

 But there is another reason: once I wrote the pep interpreter, I realised
 that it was quite easy to write "translation" nomsf://tr/ scripts which
 are *nom* scripts that translate *nom* scripts into other computer languages
 such as *go* , *java* , *tcl* , *python* , *javascript* and *ruby* . There 
 are a few more unfinished translators such as 
 "perl" www.perl.org , swift, rust etc.
 I intend to finish translators for rust, perl, dart, lisp and hopefully
 "forth" https://forth-standard.org (please don't mention *forth* )

 Since languages like *go* have good support for Unicode characters 
 (I assume, and fervently hope) and also should be "memory safe" 
 I feel that there is no reason to reimplement the pep interpreter in 
 a more robust or modern language.
