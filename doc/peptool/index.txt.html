### THE PEPTOOL FOLDER
<p>
This documentation directory is about the interpreter which is 
called *pep* (It probably shouldn't have the same name as the 
virtual machine, but I won't worry about that for now).
<p>
The *pep* interpreter is written in "plain" c. That is, not c++
nor <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org">rust</a> . Just "good old" c. Actually, if I had
known about, or known "go" <a href=" <a href="https://go.dev" <a href="https://go.dev</a>">https://go.dev">https://go.dev</a></a>">https://go.dev</a>">https://go.dev">https://go.dev</a></a></a> or *rust* or even "dart"
 <a href="https://dart.dev" <a href="https://dart.dev</a>">https://dart.dev</a></a> then I probably would have used one of those languages.
But I didn't, so I didn't.
<p>
The pep interpreter has a very handy debugging or *interactive* mode
which can be activated with the *-I* switch (and it has nice 
colours as well)
<:4:>>:<a href="http://bumble.sourceforge.net/image/peptool.interactive.22feb2025.png&gt;"><em><code>/image/peptool.interactive.22feb2025.png></code></em></a>
<p>
<strong><em>watch the virtual machine as a nom script executes</em></strong>
 <pre class="codeline"> pep -If eg/exp.tolisp.pss -i "(-b + (b^2-4*a*c)^(1/2))/(2*a)"</pre>
<p>
This is quite interesting to do, because you can see exactly how 
the *PEP* virtual machine is operating and you can also see all the 
nom statement in the *compiled* form (a sort of pseudo assembly).
<p>
The pep interactive or debug mode has many different commands, such
as *rrw* (run until the pep://workspace is a given text) or 
*ls* (list the compiled instructions). Type "hh" to see all commands.
<p>
Normally, you will not need the debug mode to actually debug scripts 
because there are easier ways: for example you can display the parse
tokens as in the following example.
<p>
<strong><em>display the parse stack tokens during script execution.</em></strong>
parse>
add "<!-- line "; lines; add " char "; chars; add ": "; print; clear; 
unstack; print; stack; add " →\n"; print; clear;
,,,,
<p>
But the *-I* switch was very handy during the implementation of the 
pep interpreter to make sure that the virtual machine was working
as expected. And it is one reason I have no desire to reimplement the 
interpreter in a different language.
<p>
But there is another reason: once I wrote the pep interpreter, I realised
that it was quite easy to write "translation" nomsf://tr/ scripts which
are *nom* scripts that translate *nom* scripts into other computer languages
such as *go* , *java* , *tcl* , *python* , *javascript* and *ruby* . There 
are a few more unfinished translators such as 
<a href="http://www.perl.org">perl</a> , swift, rust etc.
I intend to finish translators for rust, perl, dart, lisp and hopefully
"forth" <a href=" <a href="https://forth-standard.org" <a href="https://forth-standard.org</a>">https://forth-standard.org">https://forth-standard.org</a></a>">https://forth-standard.org</a>">https://forth-standard.org">https://forth-standard.org</a></a></a> (please don't mention *forth* )
<p>
Since languages like *go* have good support for Unicode characters 
(I assume, and fervently hope) and also should be "memory safe" 
I feel that there is no reason to reimplement the pep interpreter in 
a more robust or modern language.
