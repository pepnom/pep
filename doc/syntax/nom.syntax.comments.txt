## COMMENTS IN THE NOM LANGUAGE SYNTAX
   
  Including comments in [nom] scripts.

  Both single line comments (line starting with "#"), or multi-line
  comments (#* .... *#) are available.

### MULTI-LINE COMMENTS

 * how to write multi-line comments
 -----+
   read; 
   #*
     The nom code below uses the [:punct:] character class,
     which hopefully, when translated to a nice modern 
     Unicode sort of language (java, dart, go etc) will recognise
     punctuation is all different exotic scripts
   *#
   [:punct:] { clear; add "Too much punctuation."; print; quit;}
   clear;  
 ,,,,

 Multi-line comments start with "#*" and end with "*#", but they 
 cannot be nested.

 Multi-line comments are useful for disabling blocks of code
 during script *development*, as well as for long comments at the 
 beginning of a script. 

 Using multi-line comments to disable "blocks" nomsyn://block of code is very
 much as "last resort" type of debugging technique. Better debugging techniques
 are to use the "parse-stack" pep://stack watch lines just after the *parse>*
 label or use the nom://state command which shows the state of the pep
 pep://machine at the time that the *state* command is issued.

 See the document /doc/howto/nom.debug.html for more (and better) debugging
 techniques.

### SINGLE LINE COMMENTS

 These are the classic [bash] [perl] unixy comments where the all text after
 the hash # character is ignored until the end of the line (i.e \\n). There is
 not much more to say about them. The translation scripts actually translate
 [nom] comments into the target language, but this is not terribly useful.

### NOTES

 There are certain places in a nom script where comments cannot appear,
 for example between tests in a list of tests before a block. This may
 change in the future

 * currently (2025) an error
 ------+
   read;
   [:space:],
   # or punctuation. No, error, comments cannot go here.
   [:punct:] {
     nop; # do nothing. This comment is ok. 
   }
