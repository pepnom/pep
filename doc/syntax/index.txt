## /doc/syntax folder

 This folder contains information about the syntax of the [nom] language as it
 is defined in "compile.pss" nomsf://compile.pss 
 
 The file file://doc.dir.index.html contains a list of documents in 
 this folder, including pages for each element of the syntax of the 
 [nom] language.

 The document file://nom.syntax.html contains an overview of the *nom* language
 syntax, and then each aspect of the syntax is documented in a separate file.
 For example, the block tests are documents in the file
 file://nom.syntax.tests.html

### NOM SYNTAX EXAMPLE

  The example below doesn't do anything useful.

  * an example to demonstrate the syntax of nom
  -----+
    # single line comments start with '#'
    # the begin-block is likes 'awks' begin blocks
    begin { add "hello"; print; clear; }
    # all statements end with ';' except .reparse and .restart
    read;   
    # class tests are between [ and ]
    [\n] { clear; lines; add ":"; print; }

    # blocks between { and } are preceeded by 'tests'
    "/" {
      # blocks can be multiline and nested
      until '/'; 
      # tests can be negated with the ! operator and blocks can
      # be nested
      !"//" {
        put; clear; 
        # quoted parameters can be multiline, no special syntax is 
        # required.
        add '
          multiline 
          quoted
          text ';
        # single or double quotes can be used for parameters
        # there is no difference
        add "double quotes"; add 'single quotes';
        # all commands have a single character version
        # 'a' is the same add 'add', 'd' is 'clear'
        a 'text'; d;
        # no white-space between elements is required
        add'nospace'; replace'a''A'; clear;

        print; clear;
        # parse tokens like 'match*' end with a delimiter character
        # (by default '*')
        add "match*"; push;
        # jump forward or back to the 'parse>' label
        # no semicolon ; after .reparse
        .reparse
      }
    }
    #* 
     comments can be 
     multiline like this
    *#
  parse>
    
    # end-of-file and tape tests can be written 
    # with () or <> eg <eof> (eof) (==) <==>
    (eof) { add "end\n"; print; }
    # the same no difference
    <eof> { add "end\n"; print; }

### NOTES

 The syntax of [nom] is based reasonably closely on that of [sed]
 the [unix] text-stream editor. But there are a list of differences
 which I will, at some point, document in a separate page.

 Nom used braces *{}* to delineate nomsyn://blocks of statements.  
 It is normally *character-oriented* not *line-oriented* . It 
 does **not** use regular expressions (I explain the design reasons
 for this elsewhere) so it "matches" simple text-strings in the 
 pep://workspace (text) buffer.
