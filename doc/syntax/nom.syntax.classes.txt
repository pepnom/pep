## CHARACTER CLASSES IN THE NOM LANGUAGE

  Character classes are written [:space:] [:alnum:] etc. 
  The *pep* the c language implementation of the parse machine and language uses
  plain ctype.h character classes as a way of grouping characters.

  Character classes are uses in nomsyn://tests before "blocks" nomsyn://block
  These classes are important in a Unicode setting because they allow
  specifying types of characters in a locale-neutral way.  The nom://while
  and nom:whilenot commands can use character classes as their argument.

  * check if the workspace is only alphanumeric characters 
  >> r; ![:alnum:] { add " not alpha-numeric! \n"; print; } clear;

  * read the input stream while the peep register is whitespace
  >> while [:space:];
