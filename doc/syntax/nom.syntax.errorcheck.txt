## Error checking Nom syntax

 This document outlines or sketches how to error check the nom syntax. It will
 try to use new state-of-the-art error checking techniques that I have
 discovered (like pushing an error* token to reduce the verbosity of the
 script) and it will be a "green-fields" [nom] parser meaning that I will not
 base the code on previous "translators" nomsf://tr/ or compilers. This will
 allow me to use things that I have learnt since about 2019 when I first
 managed to code a decent implementation of the [pep] engine and the [nom]
 language.

 I should be able to use this error checker as the basis for an html
 *pretty-printer*
