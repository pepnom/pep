 ## STATEMENTS IN THE NOM LANGUAGE

 A *statement* is a command followed by zero, one or two *parameters* (single
 or double-quoted text) and a semi-colon. The parameters are **not** separated
 by commas. 
 
 All statements are terminated with a semi-colon except for 
 nom://reparse , nom://restart and the nomsyn://parse> label. Sequences
 of statements can be grouped together in "blocks" nomsyn://block . 
 
 The nom://replace is the only command that takes 2 quoted parameters or
 arguments.

 * replace all occurrences of "try" with "do" in the workspace buffer
 >> replace "try" "do";
 
 All nomsyn://whitespace is optional in statements and in the nom language,
 except within nomsyn://quotes and nomsyn://tests

 * no spaces are required anywhere
 >> read;replace"a""z";print;clear;  # this is ok

 Also a single statements can span multiple lines.

 * spreading out an "add" statement
