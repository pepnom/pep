## The nom parse> label

  The *parse>* label marks the start of the parsing/translation phase
  of a nom script.

  All nom://reparse commands jump back to the parse> label and this is 
  an important technique for making sure that all possible grammar 
  reductions take place.

  This label is used to mark the start of the parsing and
  translating/transpiling/compiling phase of the nom script. The section before
  the parse> label is the wp://lexical.analysis phase of the script where text
  patterns are turned into grammar tokens.

  In the compiling or translating part of the script tokens are
  "popped" nom://pop off the "stack" pep://stack
