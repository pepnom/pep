## QUOTES IN THE NOM LANGUAGE

  Both single and double quotes may be used in scripts and they have exactly
  the same role in the syntax of the nom language.  But quoted text which
  starts with a double quote (") must end with a double quote, and the same
  rules applies to single quotes.

  Quoted text can also span multiple lines.

  * use single or double quotes in pep/nom scripts
  >> r; '"' { add "<< single quote!\n"; print; } d;

  If using the negation operator "!" in an "in-line" script, then
  enclose the whole thing in single quotes, so that the shell does
  not substitute the "!" character (or other special characters).

  * use single quotes in one-line pep scripts to avoid bash substitution 
  >> pep -e '![u-z],"/",";"{print;} clear;' -i "axbycz/;"

  Prints: abc/;

  The pep/nom language syntax allows quoted text to span more than one
  line. No special syntax is required and all special characters have the
  same meaning. This is mainly only useful as the argument to the 
  "add" command, in order to improve the readability of scrips

  * A multi-line quoted text example 
  ------+
  begin { add '
    A multi-line 
    argument for "add".
    '; 
  } print; clear; quit;
  ,,,
  
  It is not necessary to have any space between a command and any
  quoted argument. This is because the pep/nom language knows how to 
  parse itself (see nomsf://compile.pss for the amazing details). In fact,
  "white-space" (\n\t\s\r\f) is not really significant anywhere in
  a nom script - except within quotes.

  * no space is required before quotes
  -----+
    read; add"."; # this is ok!
    replace"."".."; # this is be ok too.
    print;clear;
    # if the input is 'abc' this should print 'a..b..c..'
  ,,,

"ESCAPING" WITHIN QUOTES

  The until command automatically recognises "escaped" quote characters, so it
  will not stop reading the input stream when it encounters \\" or \\'

  * using single quotes, and some abbreviated commands
  >> r; 'a' { add 'A'; print; } d;

  Within quoted text, certain "escaped" characters have a special meaning.
  These characters have the same meaning in double and single quotes. 

  d/- \\n - represents a 'newline' character
    - \\r - a return character
    - \\f - a form feed (rarely used).
    - \\t - a tab

  * convert all tabs to 2 spaces in the input stream
  >> read; "\t" { clear; add "  "; } print; clear;
  
  * An abbreviated version of the above in-line pep/nom script
  >> r; "\t" { d; a "  "; } t;d;

  * create a "go" program, equivalent of the above script, compile and run
  -----+
    pep -f tr/translate.go.pss -i 'r;"\t"{d;a"  ";}t;d;' > notabs.go
    go build -o notabs notabs.go
    echo -e "no\ttabs\tplease!" | notabs
    # should print 'no  tabs  please!'
