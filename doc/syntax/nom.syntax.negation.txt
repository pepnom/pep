## NEGATION IN THE NOM LANGUAGE

 About the nom *negation* operator *!*

 The nom language uses the fairly standard *bang* operator "!" as a negation
 operator. This can be put before all types of nomsyn://tests , such as class
 tests (eg [:space:] ), text-is tests (eg "abc"), begins-with tests (eg:
 B"abc") ends-with tests (eg: E"abc") etc.

 * test that the workspace is not empty
 ----+
   read; 
   [:space:] { clear; .restart }
   [:alnum:] { 
     while [:alnum:]; put; 
     clear; add "word*"; push; .reparse
   }
  parse>
   !"" { 
     put; clear;
     add "! Incorrect character '"; get; add "'\n";
     add "! (only alpha-numeric allowed) \n"; 
     print; quit;
   }
 ,,,,

### NOTES

  In the unix text-stream editor, [sed] the negation operator goes **after**
  the test it is modifying, but in [nom] the negation operator goes **before**.

  The idiom below **!"" {...} ** is a simple way to determine if there is a
  character or characters in the input-steam which is acceptable in the current
  language.  This snippet normal goes just before the nomsyn://parse> label
  after all other characters and strings have been tokenised.

  * a common use of the negation operator
  ----+
   !"" { 
     put; clear;
     add "! Incorrect character '"; get; add "'\n";
     print; quit;
   }
  ,,,,
  
  Double negation (!!) is not permitted because it is fairly semantically
  useless (no?), and the same applies to triple, quadruple etc negation.

### SEE ALSO

  - nomsyn://tests which are the tests which precede nom nomsyn://block
    sections.
  - nomsyn://classes which can be negated by the "!" operator when they 
    are used as tests (not as an argument to the nom://while and 
    nom://whilenot commands
