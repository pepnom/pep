## NOM BEGIN BLOCKS 

  The *begin* block: nom code that is executed once at the beginning
  of the script.

  Like *awk*, the pep/nom language allows 'begin' blocks. These 
  blocks are only executed once, whereas the rest of the script
  is executed in a loop for every character in the input stream.

  The *(eof)* end-of-file or end-of-inputstream is in a sense the 
  converse of the *begin* block because it allows you to do 
  something at the *end* of the script.

  * an example begin block and 'do almost nothing' script
  -----+
    begin {
      add "Starting script ...\n"; print; clear;
      # set the token delimiter to / 
      delim "/";  
    }
    read; print; clear;
  ,,,

  * convert text to a basic html document using begin and (eof)
  --------+
    begin { add "<html><body><pre>\n"; print; clear; } 
    read; 
    replace "&" "&amp;"; 
    replace ">" "&gt;"; 
    replace "<" "&lt;"; 
    print; clear;
    (eof) { add "\n</pre></body></pre>\n"; print; clear;}
