## GRAMMAR TOKENS IN THE NOM LANGUAGE

 Grammar *parse* tokens in the [nom] language.

 Actually there is no such thing as a *parse token* or *grammar token*
 within the amazing Nom language. This is because in Nom everything is
 just *text* (hopefully Unicode/UTF8/etc text). But the structure of a 
 *nom* script is designed to reflect the structure of the grammar that 
 you are parsing or translating or compiling. 

 This is achieved with the pep://delimiter register which determines 
 where the *pep* machine will see a parse token as starting or stopping.
 An example should make this clearer than mud....

 * three tokens in the workspace buffer
 -----+
   pop;pop;pop
   "quotedword*url*dot*" {
     # do something with the parse token quotedword, url and dot
   }
 ,,,,

 As can be seen above, the parse-tokens are delimited by a single 
 character, the "*" asterix. But this is just a matter of preference.
 You can change the parse token delimiter to whatever you like
 with the nom://delim
