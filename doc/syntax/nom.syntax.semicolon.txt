## THE SEMICOLON IN THE "NOM" LANGUAGE SYNTAX

  The role of the semicolon *;* in syntax of the [nom] language.

  All statements must be terminated with a semicolon in the *Nom*
  parsing language with the exception of the following:
  >> .reparse, .restart, and blocks *{...}*

  I chose not to allow a semicolon after .reparse and .restart to emphasise the
  fact that they are *jumps* back to the nomsyn://parse> label or to the start
  of the script (but after the nomsyn://begin block).
