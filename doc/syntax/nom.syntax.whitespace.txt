 ## WHITESPACE IN THE NOM LANGUAGE

 The role of *whitespace* in the syntax of the [nom] language.
 
 The *Nom* compiler nomsf://compile.pss, which is itself a 
 nom script (cool, hey?) pretty much ignores all whitespace except
 within "quoted" nomsyn://quotes text (that is text between " and " 
 or ' and '). That means that you can put as much, or as little 
 google://whitespace in your scripts as you want. Go for it.

 * parsimonious use of whitespace  
 >> read;replace"a""A";print;clear;

 * make it more cryptic with single character commands 
 >> r;D"a""A";t;d;  # to make "sed" users feel at home

 * go to town with whitespace
 ----+
   read;

   #*
     let's make dart/flutter programmers
     feel at 
     home
   *#
   replace 
     "a" 
     "A"
     ;
   print;          clear;
 ,,,,

 Also, quoted text can span multiple lines like this

 * multiline add command
 ----+
   read; add ":
      one character "; print clear
 ,,,
