## REGULAR EXPRESSIONS IN THE NOM LANGUAGE 

 About regular expressions in the nom language (there aren't any).

 This could be the shortest document here: There are 
 **no** "regular expressions" wp://regular.expression in the *nom* language
 and the *pep* virtual "machine" pep://machine . This may seem a 
 strange and self-defeating design decision, but actually I believe that 
 it is a stroke of genius.

 Regular expressions can be slow and they are also quite bulky to implement.
 I believe approximately 4000 lines of c code is required to implement
 a regex engine. I note with interest that the inventor of Lua also 
 decided not to implement a full regular expression engine in that language.

 But there are other reasons, not to include regexes in the nom language 
 and some of them are psychological. It seems to be a great temptation 
 for programmers to try to make context-free patterns with regular 
 expression patterns, even when they know, or have been told that it is 
 not possible.

 Most parser generators (such as "ANTLR" www.antlr.org ) include support 
 for regular expressions during the "lexical analysis" wp://lexical.analysis
 phase of the parsing and compiling process. Surprisingly regular expressions
 do not seem necessary for most parsing applications, although sometimes
 their absence makes the grammar more complex.

 For example, the nom script /eg/text.tohtml.pss does (in my opinion)
 a quite reasonable job of turning plain text patterns into html without
 the use of regular expressions (this script is the engine that renders
 the website www.nomlang.org where this documentation is located).

 The lack of regular expression support in the "lexing" phase of the *nom*
 script means that the implementation of pep and nom is considerably simpler
 than other tools and this is one of the primary aims of the pep/nom
 system: simplicity.
